What's the difference between Sdr and HDR on my screen 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The difference between SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) and HDR (High Dynamic Range) on your screen is in how they handle brightness, contrast, and color:

Brightness and Contrast:

SDR: Has a limited range of brightness levels. It typically maxes out at 100 nits and struggles with extreme highlights or deep shadows.
HDR: Can handle a much wider range of brightness, often exceeding 1,000 nits. It can display bright highlights and deep shadows simultaneously, making images look more lifelike.
Color Range:

SDR: Supports a smaller color gamut (e.g., Rec. 709). Colors are less vibrant and realistic compared to HDR.
HDR: Uses a wider color gamut (e.g., Rec. 2020 or DCI-P3), allowing for more vivid and accurate colors.
Details in Highlights and Shadows:

SDR: May "blow out" bright areas or "crush" dark areas, losing detail in those extremes.
HDR: Preserves detail in both very bright and very dark areas, giving more depth to scenes.
Immersion:

SDR: Good for standard viewing, but less immersive.
HDR: Feels more dynamic and engaging, especially in games or movies designed for HDR.
If you’ve got HDR content and your Dell S3221QS supports it, switching to HDR will give you a richer visual experience. However, some SDR content may look overly dark or washed out in HDR mode if the content or settings aren’t optimized. It's worth toggling between them to see what looks best for specific tasks.

Okay it works now, on my actually desktop it looks like words are harder to read, is that normal? 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, that's a common issue with HDR on Windows desktops. HDR is designed for enhancing colors and brightness in media like games or videos, but it can make text and UI elements look less crisp or harder to read. This happens because Windows doesn't always handle HDR content and standard desktop tasks (like text rendering) equally well.

Why Text Looks Harder to Read in HDR:
Color Accuracy Prioritized Over Clarity:
HDR changes how brightness and color are displayed, and it sometimes affects text contrast and sharpness.
Improper Calibration:
The brightness and contrast settings may be too high, making text appear washed out.
Scaling Issues:
Windows might not scale fonts and UI elements properly in HDR mode.
Fixes to Improve Text Clarity:
Adjust HDR Brightness:

Go to Settings > Display > HDR Settings.
Adjust the SDR content brightness slider to make SDR (text, UI) elements more visible and balanced.
Calibrate HDR Settings:

Use the HDR Calibration Tool in Windows (via the Xbox Game Bar):
Press Win + G to open Game Bar.
Select HDR Calibration and follow the steps to optimize brightness and color balance.
Enable ClearType:

Open Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization > Fonts > Adjust ClearType text.
Run the ClearType setup to make text sharper.
Switch Back to SDR for Desktop Tasks:

If you only need HDR for gaming (like Final Fantasy XVI), you can toggle HDR off when using the desktop:
Go to Settings > Display and turn Use HDR off temporarily.
Turn it back on when launching HDR-supported games or media.
Check Your Monitor Settings:

Lower the overall brightness or change the monitor’s HDR mode (e.g., switch from HDR Game to HDR Desktop).

Look at the Max Temperature column for CPU and GPU. This shows the highest temp reached before the system restarted.
Example:
CPU Max: 85°C (safe).
GPU Max: 90°C (upper safe limit).
If the Max Temperature values seem normal, we’ll move on to other potential issues. Let me know what you find!

Ice installed latest drivers, didn't do clean install though 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Good call on updating the drivers, but a clean install is often necessary when troubleshooting crashes or restarts. Old or corrupted driver remnants can conflict with new updates, causing instability. It’s worth redoing the installation to ensure everything is fresh.

How to Perform a Clean Install of NVIDIA Drivers:
Open GeForce Experience:

Launch GeForce Experience from the Start menu or system tray.
Download the Latest Driver:

Go to the Drivers tab and click Download for the latest version (even if it's already updated).
Select Custom Installation:

After the download completes, click Custom Installation instead of Express.
Perform Clean Install:

Check the box that says Perform a clean installation.
This will remove all old driver files and settings before installing the new ones.
Restart Your PC:

Once the installation completes, restart your computer.
Test the Game Again:
After the clean install, try launching Final Fantasy XVI and see if it resolves the restart issue. If it still restarts, we’ll focus on other factors like temperatures or memory. Let me know!

When loading final fantasy, the compelling shaders part, takes ages, 7-10minutes 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The long "Compiling Shaders" phase indicates your system is working hard to optimize the game for your hardware. While it’s normal for some games (especially modern, graphically intense ones like Final Fantasy XVI), 7–10 minutes is unusually long and suggests a potential issue. Let’s address it.

Why Shader Compilation is Slow:
Disk Speed:
If the game is installed on a slower HDD instead of an SSD, shader compilation will take much longer.
Driver Issues:
Corrupted or outdated GPU drivers can slow down shader compilation.
RAM Bottleneck:
If you have 16GB RAM, it may be struggling to keep up with both the game and background tasks.
Background Processes:
Programs like antivirus, Windows Update, or other background apps can interfere with shader compilation.
Steps to Speed Up Shader Compilation:
1. Ensure the Game is on an SSD:
Move the game to an SSD if it’s currently on an HDD.
In Steam: Right-click the game > Properties > Installed Files > Move Install Folder.
SSDs dramatically speed up loading and shader compilation.
2. Update GPU Drivers (Clean Install):
If you haven’t performed a clean install yet, do so now.
Follow the clean install steps I shared earlier to clear out old driver remnants.
3. Free Up RAM:
Close all unnecessary programs before launching the game:
Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and end tasks that aren’t essential (e.g., browsers, Discord).
Restart your PC before playing to ensure no lingering processes are using up memory.
4. Verify Game Files:
Corrupted files can cause slow shader compilation.
In Steam:
Right-click the game > Properties > Installed Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files.
This will re-download any missing or corrupted files.
5. Wait for One-Time Compilation:
The "Compiling Shaders" step should be a one-time process.
Once done, it won’t recompile unless there’s a significant update or you reinstall the game.
Test Again:
After addressing these issues, restart the game and check if shader compilation improves. Let me know how it goes!






You said:
I do have 16GB
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
With 16GB of RAM, you should still be able to run Final Fantasy XVI effectively, but it’s near the minimum threshold for demanding modern games. The long shader compilation time may indicate RAM-related bottlenecks, especially if the game is eating a large chunk of memory alongside background processes.

Let’s optimize your system for your current RAM:

How to Optimize Performance with 16GB RAM:
1. Free Up Memory:
Close all unnecessary apps before running the game:
Use Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) to end processes like browsers, Discord, Spotify, etc.
Disable Windows Startup Apps:
Go to Settings > Apps > Startup and toggle off unnecessary apps.
2. Increase Virtual Memory (Page File):
When your physical RAM is maxed out, Windows uses your disk as additional memory.
Steps to Set Page File:
Search Advanced System Settings in the Start menu.
Click Settings under Performance.
Go to the Advanced tab and click Change under Virtual Memory.
Uncheck Automatically manage paging file size.
Select your SSD (if available) and choose Custom Size.
Initial Size: 24000 MB (1.5x your RAM).
Maximum Size: 32000 MB (2–3x your RAM).
Click Set and restart your PC.
3. Lower In-Game Settings:
Reduce Texture Quality and Effects Quality in the game settings.
These settings heavily use RAM and VRAM.
Turn off or lower Ray Tracing if it’s enabled.
4. Run the Game in Performance Mode:
Switch Windows power settings to High Performance:
Go to Settings > Power & Sleep > Additional Power Settings.
Choose High Performance or AMD Ryzen Balanced.
5. Upgrade RAM (Future Consideration):
If shader compilation remains slow and the game frequently pushes memory usage to 90%+, consider upgrading to 32GB RAM. This will help avoid memory bottlenecks entirely, especially for modern AAA games.
After these steps, try launching the game again to see if shader compilation speeds up. Let me know how it performs!






You said:
It's only at 75% though, it's the CPU that's at 100% GPU is at 25%
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Ah, so the issue lies with CPU hitting 100% during shader compilation while the GPU is underutilized. This suggests that your CPU is overloaded, which is why the process takes so long and likely contributes to system instability.

Why the CPU is Overloaded During Shader Compilation:
Shader compilation is a CPU-intensive task—it's compiling and optimizing shaders for the GPU.
If the CPU is bottlenecking, the GPU can’t be fully utilized, which is why it’s only at 25% usage.
Background processes or unoptimized settings may be making it worse.
Steps to Fix the CPU Bottleneck:
1. Prioritize the Game's CPU Usage:
Open Task Manager while the game is running.
Right-click Final Fantasy XVI in the Processes tab.
Select Go to Details, then right-click the process again and set Priority to High.
2. Limit CPU-Heavy Background Processes:
In Task Manager, sort processes by CPU usage and end non-essential ones.
Common offenders:
Windows Update
Antivirus software (temporarily disable it)
Overlays (Discord, Steam, NVIDIA, etc.)
3. Lower Shader Cache Load on CPU:
Adjust GPU settings to help with shader caching:
Open NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Global Settings.
Find Shader Cache Size and set it to Unlimited.
This allows the GPU to store and reuse compiled shaders, reducing future CPU strain.
4. Cap FPS Temporarily:
High FPS during loading phases can increase CPU load.
In NVIDIA Control Panel or in-game settings, cap the frame rate to 60 FPS (or lower temporarily).
5. Disable Overlays:
Turn off CPU-heavy overlays:
Discord: Go to Settings > Overlay > Turn Off Overlay.
Steam: Go to Settings > In-Game > Uncheck Enable Steam Overlay.
NVIDIA: Disable the GeForce Experience in-game overlay.
6. Reinstall GPU Drivers (Clean Install):
If you haven’t done a clean install of NVIDIA drivers yet, now’s the time. Corrupted or incomplete drivers can offload tasks meant for the GPU onto the CPU.
7. Monitor CPU Temps During Compilation:
If CPU temps spike during compilation, it may throttle performance:
Use HWMonitor to check temps during the process.
Safe Temp Range: 40–85°C.
If temps are too high, ensure your cooler is functioning properly or reapply thermal paste.
After applying these fixes, restart the game and check if shader compilation speeds up and CPU usage drops. Let me know how it behaves!






You said:
The only thing that's using CPU is final fantasy at 93, while its still in the compiling shaders bit, is that even normal?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It’s not unusual for Final Fantasy XVI to use a high percentage of the CPU during shader compilation because it’s a CPU-intensive task. However, 93% CPU usage sustained for 7–10 minutes seems excessive, even for a demanding game. This suggests the process might not be optimized for your system or something else is amplifying the load.

What’s Normal During Shader Compilation?
CPU Usage: It’s expected to be high (~80–90%) but not 100% for extended periods. It should drop once the game finishes compiling.
GPU Usage: Often low during this phase because the task is CPU-bound.
Compilation Time: Should take 1–3 minutes on a powerful system. 7–10 minutes is excessive.
Possible Causes of High CPU Usage:
Inefficient Shader Compilation:
Some games poorly optimize shader compilation, overburdening the CPU.
Driver or Game File Corruption:
Corrupted GPU drivers or game files can increase CPU workload unnecessarily.
Background Interference:
Even if Final Fantasy XVI is the main process, background Windows tasks (e.g., indexing, updates) can still interfere.
Thermal Throttling:
If the CPU overheats during shader compilation, it could throttle, extending the process.
Steps to Reduce CPU Usage and Compilation Time:
1. Limit CPU Usage Temporarily:
Use a frame rate cap:
Open NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Program Settings (select Final Fantasy XVI).
Set Max Frame Rate to 60 FPS.
This eases CPU load during the compilation phase.
2. Verify Game Files:
Corrupted game files can cause inefficiencies.
On Steam:
Right-click the game > Properties > Installed Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files.
This will redownload missing or corrupted files.
3. Disable Windows Power Throttling:
Ensure the CPU runs at full power:
Go to Control Panel > Power Options.
Select High Performance or AMD Ryzen Balanced.
4. Monitor CPU Temps During Compilation:
Open HWMonitor and note CPU temps while the game is compiling.
Safe Temps: Below 85°C.
If temps spike above this, clean your cooler or reapply thermal paste.
5. Rebuild the Shader Cache:
Sometimes, an old or corrupted shader cache slows the process.
Delete the shader cache:
Go to NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Shader Cache.
Turn it Off, then back On.
Restart your PC and launch the game.
Test After Tweaks
Try these steps, then re-launch Final Fantasy XVI. The goal is to bring down compilation time and stabilize CPU usage. Let me know how it goes!






You said:

Current temperatures
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your CPU temperatures are running high during shader compilation, with cores peaking at 89°C and the package hitting 90°C. This is close to the Ryzen 5 5600X's safe thermal limit of 90–95°C. Sustained temperatures at this range are likely causing thermal throttling and instability, which could explain the crashes and excessive CPU usage.

Immediate Steps to Reduce CPU Temps:
Check CPU Cooling:

Ensure your CPU cooler is functioning properly (fans spinning at higher speeds under load).
Tighten the cooler if it's loose.
Clean dust off the cooler and fans to improve airflow.
Increase Fan Speeds:

Go into your BIOS/UEFI and set your CPU fan profile to Performance or Turbo mode.
Alternatively, use a tool like MSI Afterburner or Fan Control to manually increase CPU fan RPMs under load.
Improve Airflow:

Remove any obstructions near your CPU cooler.
Ensure case fans are spinning properly to bring in cool air and exhaust hot air.
Reapply Thermal Paste (Optional but Recommended):

If the thermal paste between your CPU and cooler is old or poorly applied, it may not conduct heat efficiently.
Reapply high-quality thermal paste for better cooling.
Lower CPU Power Limit (Temporary Fix):

In the BIOS, set a lower PPT (Power Package Tracking) Limit for the CPU. This will reduce power consumption and heat generation but may slightly reduce performance during shader compilation.
Cap FPS and Lower Game Settings:

In NVIDIA Control Panel:
Limit the FPS to 60 to ease CPU load.
Disable Ray Tracing or lower settings that stress the CPU during shader compilation.
Long-Term Considerations:
If temperatures remain high despite these fixes, consider upgrading to a better CPU cooler (e.g., a quality air cooler like the Noctua NH-D15 or a 240mm AIO liquid cooler).
After addressing the temps, try running the game again and monitor the new peak temperatures. Let me know how it goes!






You said:
It crashed. I didn't really see the cpu or GPU spike. Loading hwmonitor up after snakes all temps on CPU below 69
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the system crashed again and the CPU temps stayed below 69°C (which is completely safe), the cause is unlikely to be thermal throttling. We can now shift focus to other possibilities.

Likely Causes and Next Steps:
1. Power Supply Instability:
Even though your 750W PSU (TX750M) is sufficient, sudden GPU or CPU spikes during shader compilation or loading could trigger instability.
What to Check:
If the power cables to the RTX 3080 Ti are securely connected.
If your PSU is old (over 5+ years), it might not be delivering stable power under sudden load.
Test:
Run a stress test for both CPU and GPU simultaneously using tools like FurMark (GPU) and Prime95 (CPU).
If the PC restarts, it’s likely a PSU issue.
2. Memory Instability (RAM):
High system memory load at 96% suggests Final Fantasy XVI is maxing out your 16GB RAM, and unstable RAM can cause crashes.
What to Do:
Run Windows Memory Diagnostic:
Press Win + R, type mdsched.exe, and press Enter.
Let it scan for RAM errors.
Increase your virtual memory (Page File):
Go to Advanced System Settings > Performance Settings > Advanced > Virtual Memory.
Set a Custom Size:
Initial: 24000 MB (1.5x RAM)
Max: 32000 MB (2x RAM)
This will reduce memory-related crashes by providing virtual "backup" RAM.
3. Faulty GPU Drivers or Hardware:
Crashes during shader compilation could stem from the GPU:
Corrupted drivers may cause instability.
Steps:
Use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) to fully clean GPU drivers.
Boot into Safe Mode and use DDU to remove all NVIDIA drivers.
Reinstall the latest drivers via NVIDIA’s site.
Stress Test the GPU:
Use FurMark to check for GPU instability under load.
4. Final Fantasy XVI-Specific Bug:
Shader compilation crashes might be related to game files or optimization issues.
What to Try:
Verify game files through Steam.
Reinstall the game (if possible).
Let me know which of these steps you want to focus on first—power, RAM stability, or GPU testing—and we’ll troubleshoot further.






You said:
Please can you just say one thing at a time 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Got it—let’s take this step by step. Since the CPU and GPU temps were stable during the crash, let’s check your RAM stability next, as your memory usage was very high.

Step 1: Run Windows Memory Diagnostic
Press Win + R to open the Run dialog.
Type mdsched.exe and press Enter.
Select Restart now and check for problems.
Your PC will restart, and Windows will run a RAM check.
Let it complete (it may take several minutes).
Once it finishes, let me know if it finds any errors or issues with your RAM. If everything comes back clean, we’ll move to the next step.






You said:
No issues 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Good—RAM is fine. Now let’s check if the issue is GPU-related, as shader compilation and game crashes can point to GPU instability.

Step 2: Stress Test Your GPU
We’ll use FurMark to stress your GPU and monitor its stability.

Download FurMark from here.
Install and run FurMark.
Set the resolution to 1080p and click GPU Stress Test.
Monitor the test:
Check GPU temperatures and ensure they stay below 85°C.
Watch for visual artifacts, stutters, or restarts.
Let the test run for about 10 minutes. If your PC restarts, crashes, or shows errors, the GPU or PSU might be the culprit. Let me know what happens!






You said:
Average temperature 63, no issues after about 8minutes
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Alright, so the GPU is stable under load, and temps are perfectly fine at 63°C. That rules out overheating or basic GPU instability. Since we've also ruled out RAM and CPU temps as issues, let’s focus on the game files or software conflicts next.

Step 3: Verify Game Files (Steam or Epic Games Launcher)
Open your game launcher (Steam or Epic Games).
For Steam:
Right-click Final Fantasy XVI in your Library.
Select Properties > Local Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files.
This will scan and repair any corrupted or missing files.
For Epic Games:
Go to your Library.
Click the three dots next to the game > Verify.
This ensures the game files aren’t corrupted, which could cause shader compilation crashes. Let me know if it finds anything or if the game still restarts after this.






You said:
Have we ruled out CPU?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're right—let’s not jump ahead. While your GPU and RAM are stable, we haven’t fully ruled out the CPU as a cause, especially since it was at 100% during shader compilation. Let’s test the CPU under heavy load to confirm its stability.

Step 4: Stress Test Your CPU
We’ll use Prime95 to push the CPU and see if it remains stable.

Download Prime95 from here.
Run the program and select "Just Stress Testing".
Choose Blend Test (this tests both CPU and memory together).
Monitor the test:
Keep HWMonitor running to track CPU temperatures.
Let it run for about 10–15 minutes.
Watch for:
Temperatures exceeding 85°C.
System restarts or crashes.
If the system crashes or the CPU temps spike beyond safe levels, the issue is likely CPU-related. If it passes, we can confidently rule out the CPU.

Let me know how it goes!






You said:
Which temps am I looking at 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
When running Prime95, you want to watch the following CPU temperatures in HWMonitor:

Package Temperature:

This is the overall temperature of the CPU package.
Safe Limit: Below 85°C (ideally). Anything above 90°C for sustained periods could cause throttling or instability.
Core Temperatures:

Look at the individual core temps under your Ryzen 5 5600X.
These should also stay below 85°C.
CCD/SoC Temps:

CCD (Core Complex Die) and SoC temps can help spot uneven heat issues, though they’re typically lower.
Keep them under 85°C as well.
If your CPU hits 90°C or higher, stop the test immediately to avoid damage or thermal throttling. Let the test run for about 10–15 minutes and let me know the highest temps you see or if it crashes.






You said:
4 mins in. Package is at 90. Ccs 88, cores 88
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Those temperatures are too high for the Ryzen 5 5600X under load. Sustaining 90°C on the package and 88°C on the cores indicates thermal throttling is very likely happening. This can cause system instability, restarts, and the performance issues you're experiencing with Final Fantasy XVI.

Next Steps: Fix CPU Overheating
1. Increase Cooling Efficiency:
Clean the CPU Cooler:
Dust on the cooler or heatsink reduces its efficiency.
Use compressed air to clean the fan and heatsink.
Check Cooler Mounting:
Ensure the CPU cooler is properly seated and making full contact with the CPU.
Improve Airflow:
Add more case fans or reposition existing ones for better airflow.
Ensure the case isn’t blocked or in a confined space.
2. Reapply Thermal Paste:
If the cooler is clean and mounted correctly, the thermal paste may be old or poorly applied.
Steps:
Remove the cooler, clean off old thermal paste with isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free cloth.
Apply a small pea-sized dot of high-quality thermal paste (like Arctic MX-4 or Noctua NT-H1).
Remount the cooler firmly.
3. Increase Fan Speeds:
Go to your BIOS/UEFI and set the CPU fan profile to Performance or Turbo mode.
Alternatively, use software like Fan Control or your motherboard's fan control tool to manually increase fan RPM.
4. Consider a Better CPU Cooler (If Needed):
If you’re using the stock cooler, it might not be sufficient for sustained high loads. Upgrading to a higher-end air cooler (like the Noctua NH-D15) or an AIO liquid cooler (240mm or 280mm) can significantly drop temps.
Retest After Fixes
Once cooling improvements are made, rerun Prime95 to ensure CPU temps stay below 85°C. Let me know what step you'd like to try first, and I’ll guide you through it!






You said:
Okay so break it down for me to understand better. So using this stress test, prime95. My CPU temps shouldn't go about 90ish? It should sustain itself for 10-15minutes? Therefore it's over heating?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Exactly, you’ve got it. Let’s break it down clearly:

What Should Happen in Prime95:
Temperatures:

Your CPU (Ryzen 5 5600X) temps should stay below 85°C under heavy load.
Hitting 90°C or above is a sign of overheating.
Sustaining Stability:

The CPU should handle the stress test for 10–15 minutes without crashing, throttling, or overheating.
If it goes over 90°C, the CPU might:
Throttle performance (to cool itself down).
Restart the system (as a safety measure).
What Your Test Showed:
Your Package and Cores hit 90°C and 88°C just 4 minutes in.
This means your CPU is overheating and likely throttling or causing instability.
Final Fantasy XVI’s shader compilation phase stresses your CPU in a similar way, which explains the restarts.
Why This Matters:
CPUs are designed to handle heavy loads, but sustained temps above 90°C are dangerous because:

It shortens the CPU’s lifespan.
It causes the system to throttle or crash to prevent damage.
Next Step:
We need to address the CPU cooling issue (like I suggested earlier: clean the cooler, check mounting, reapply thermal paste, or improve fan speeds). Which of these would you like to try first? I’ll walk you through it!






You said:
To clarify, it restarts once I start the game and it's showing graphics 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Got it. If the restart happens specifically when the game starts showing graphics—not during CPU-heavy tasks like shader compilation—then the GPU or power supply (PSU) is likely the culprit, not the CPU overheating alone.

Here’s the updated breakdown:

Why It Restarts During Graphics Rendering:
GPU Power Spike:

When the game starts rendering graphics, your RTX 3080 Ti demands a sudden power surge.
If the PSU can’t handle this spike (even with 750W), it causes a system restart.
GPU Instability:

Faulty or corrupted GPU drivers, or a hardware issue with the GPU, can cause restarts under load.
Thermal Issues:

Although your CPU was hot, the GPU’s temps under load need to be checked. A GPU overheating can also trigger a restart.
Next Step: Stress Test GPU and Monitor PSU Stability
1. Repeat FurMark (This Time Watch Power and Stability):
Run FurMark for 10–15 minutes to simulate heavy GPU load.
Watch for:
Sudden restarts (indicating a power issue).
Temps exceeding 85°C.
2. Monitor Power Draw:
Use HWMonitor or GPU-Z to check the Power Consumption (Watts) of the GPU during FurMark.
If it spikes near the 300–350W range and causes a restart, the PSU may not be delivering stable power.
3. Ensure GPU Power Cables Are Secure:
Your RTX 3080 Ti needs two separate 8-pin power cables directly from the PSU.
Double-check that both cables are firmly connected.
Let’s run the FurMark test again, watching power stability and GPU temps closely this time. If the PC restarts, it’s almost certainly pointing to the PSU. Let me know the results!






You said:
I'm sure it's not the GPU though, when the game plays, the fans aren't even kicking in (they will if it's overheating)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the GPU fans aren't even kicking in when the game starts rendering, it does suggest the GPU is not under significant load, shifting the focus back to the CPU or potentially the PSU. Given this behavior, let's revisit what happens during those initial moments:

What's Happening:
When graphics begin, Final Fantasy XVI:
Offloads some work to the GPU.
Continues stressing the CPU for things like game logic, physics, or shader management.
Demands more power from the PSU due to combined CPU + GPU activity.
If the CPU is already close to overheating (like it was during the Prime95 test), the additional stress could push it over the limit, causing the restart. Alternatively, the PSU might fail to supply stable power under this load.

Next Step: Rule Out the CPU First
Run Prime95 Again + Light GPU Load:

Simulate game-like conditions:
Run Prime95 Blend Test (CPU stress) AND a light GPU workload (e.g., FurMark at low resolution).
Monitor:
CPU and GPU temps.
Stability (any restarts or crashes).
Monitor CPU Temps Closely:

Check if the CPU temps spike above 90°C again during this combined load.
If the system restarts here, it’s very likely the CPU overheating.
If the CPU Passes:
We’ll focus on the PSU next, testing for instability or voltage drops under load.
Let me know the outcome of the CPU + GPU combined test, and we’ll narrow it down!






You said:
I might turn the graphics down to minimum, then grer it?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
That's a smart idea—turning the graphics settings down to minimum is a quick way to see if reducing the load stabilizes your system. This approach works because it minimizes stress on both the CPU and GPU, potentially avoiding the trigger for the restart.

Steps to Lower Graphics Settings:
Launch Final Fantasy XVI.
Go to the Settings > Graphics menu before loading into the game.
Turn everything to the lowest or off:
Resolution: Set to 1080p.
V-Sync: Turn ON (caps FPS and reduces CPU/GPU load spikes).
Shadows: Set to Low.
Texture Quality: Set to Low.
Anti-Aliasing: Turn OFF.
Ray Tracing: Turn OFF (if enabled).
Why This Helps:
Lower CPU Load: Reduces the strain from handling game physics and logic.
Lower GPU Load: Prevents high power demands or spikes from the GPU.
Power Balance: Eases the combined stress on your PSU.
Test the Game:
If the game runs fine with these settings, we know the restart is tied to higher load conditions.
Gradually increase the settings one by one (starting with Resolution or Texture Quality) to identify the breaking point.
Let me know how it behaves at minimum settings!






You said:
I couldn't see the temps, but the CPU was rising and it went to around 85 and then my system restarted 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your CPU hit ~85°C and the system restarted, the issue is almost certainly CPU overheating or instability under load. While 85°C isn’t catastrophic, it suggests that sustained load might be tipping your system over its limits. Here’s the next step to fix this:

Immediate Fixes for CPU Overheating:
1. Reapply Thermal Paste:
Old or poorly applied thermal paste can lead to insufficient heat transfer.
Steps:
Turn off the PC and remove the CPU cooler.
Clean the old thermal paste from the CPU and cooler using isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free cloth.
Apply a small pea-sized dot of high-quality thermal paste (e.g., Arctic MX-4 or Noctua NT-H1).
Reattach the cooler securely.
2. Boost Cooling:
Check CPU Cooler:
Ensure the fan is spinning properly.
If using the stock cooler, consider upgrading to a better air cooler or an AIO liquid cooler.
Increase Fan Speeds:
Go into your BIOS/UEFI and set the CPU fan profile to Turbo or manually increase the fan curve.
3. Improve Case Airflow:
Ensure case fans are positioned correctly:
Front fans = intake (blow air in).
Rear/top fans = exhaust (blow air out).
Clean any dust buildup in the case and ensure it’s in a well-ventilated area.
4. Limit CPU Power (Temporary Fix):
In BIOS/UEFI:
Reduce the PPT (Package Power Tracking) Limit or set the CPU TDP lower than default.
This will reduce power consumption and heat generation at the cost of slight performance drops.
Retest After Fixes:
Once you’ve addressed cooling, rerun Prime95 Blend Test or start the game again to see if the system remains stable. Let me know what you’d like to start with, and I can guide you through the details!

Should final fantasy 16 even push my CPU to that limit, do some research online to see if this has happened to others 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Final Fantasy XVI is a graphically intensive game that can push hardware to its limits, leading to overheating issues on various systems. While most reports focus on PlayStation 5 consoles experiencing overheating during gameplay 
TECHRADAR
, similar stress on PC components is plausible, especially if cooling solutions are inadequate.

Given that your CPU temperatures are reaching critical levels during gameplay, it's likely that the game is heavily taxing your processor, leading to overheating and system restarts.

Recommendations:

Enhance Cooling: Ensure your CPU cooler is efficient and properly installed. Consider upgrading to a more robust cooling solution if necessary.

Optimize In-Game Settings: Lowering graphics settings can reduce CPU load. Switching to performance modes that favor frame rate over visual fidelity may help alleviate the strain on your CPU.

Maintain System Cleanliness: Regularly clean your PC to prevent dust buildup, which can impede airflow and cooling efficiency.

While direct reports of Final Fantasy XVI causing CPU overheating on PCs are limited, the game's demanding nature suggests that such issues are plausible, particularly in systems with marginal cooling solutions.

If the problem persists after implementing these measures, it may be beneficial to consult with a professional technician to assess your system's cooling capabilities and overall health.

Not necessarily! While Final Fantasy XVI is clearly demanding, your system is powerful enough—it's just that overheating or an unoptimized setup is holding it back. With the right adjustments, you should still be able to play it, but you may need to take a few targeted steps to stabilize your system.

Why It’s Still Possible:

Your restarts are happening at CPU temps of 85–90°C, which means addressing the cooling issue should make a significant difference.
Settings Tweaks Help:

Lowering settings (particularly CPU-heavy ones) like shadows, NPC density, or resolution, can ease the load and prevent overheating.
What to Try Next:
Reapply Thermal Paste and Check Cooling:

This is the single most effective fix for CPU overheating. If the current paste or cooler isn't cutting it, your CPU can’t keep up under load.
Cap Frame Rates:

In NVIDIA Control Panel, set a frame rate cap of 60 FPS to reduce spikes in CPU and GPU usage.
Gradually Lower In-Game Settings:

Test low/medium settings one at a time to find the sweet spot.
Consider a Cooler Upgrade:

If you’re using a stock cooler, a high-quality aftermarket cooler (like Noctua or an AIO) can bring temps down dramatically.
Let me know if you’re willing to try cooling adjustments or tweaks, and I’ll guide you step-by-step. There’s still a good chance to get the game running!






You said:
I guess the fact that I can't hold a prime test for more than 5minufes highly suggests my CPU isn't handing high stress very well 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Exactly—failing a Prime95 stress test within 5 minutes strongly indicates your CPU isn’t handling high stress, which aligns with the restarts when playing Final Fantasy XVI. The CPU is struggling under load, and this is almost certainly due to thermal issues or cooling inadequacy.

Why This Happens:
Thermal Throttling:
Your CPU reaches high temperatures (85°C+) quickly during heavy loads, which may trigger throttling or safety shutdowns to prevent damage.
Cooling Limitations:
A poorly seated cooler, old thermal paste, or inadequate airflow could cause this overheating.
Power/Voltage Issues (Less Likely):
If cooling adjustments don’t help, the CPU may not be getting stable power from the motherboard or PSU.
What This Means:
Without addressing the cooling problem, you won’t be able to run demanding tasks like Prime95, shader compilation, or games like Final Fantasy XVI reliably.

What to Do Next:
1. Reapply Thermal Paste and Check Cooler (Most Likely Fix)
Old or poorly applied thermal paste often leads to this kind of overheating. This is the first step to stabilize your system.
Remove the cooler, clean the CPU and cooler base, and reapply a fresh layer of high-quality thermal paste.
Make sure the cooler is securely mounted and fans are spinning properly.
2. Increase Airflow:
Clean out dust from the case and ensure good airflow with properly positioned fans.
3. Upgrade Cooling Solution (If Needed):
If you’re using a stock cooler, it’s likely not enough for sustained high loads. A high-performance air cooler or AIO liquid cooler can bring temps down by 10–20°C.
4. Limit CPU Power Temporarily (BIOS Adjustment):
In the BIOS, reduce the PPT (Power Package Tracking) limit or lower the CPU core voltage slightly. This reduces heat generation at the cost of a small performance drop.
Once you fix the cooling, retest with Prime95 to ensure the CPU can handle 10–15 minutes without overheating. Let me know which step you’d like to focus on, and I’ll walk you through it!

What's the chances I need to buy a new processor?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The chances you’ll need a new processor are relatively low at this stage. Your Ryzen 5 5600X is a robust and modern CPU, so unless there’s been physical damage or a manufacturing defect, the overheating and instability are almost certainly tied to cooling or power delivery, not the processor itself.

Why Your Processor is Likely Fine:
Overheating is Usually Fixable:

High temps and throttling are common issues caused by insufficient cooling (thermal paste, cooler efficiency, or airflow) rather than a defective CPU.
These can almost always be resolved without replacing the CPU.
Processor Age and Durability:

The Ryzen 5 5600X is built on a 7nm process and designed to handle high performance reliably.
Unless the CPU has been subjected to extreme overheating for long periods (e.g., 100°C+), permanent damage is unlikely.
Stress Test Fails Don’t Always Mean Hardware Failure:

Failing Prime95 is often tied to cooling inadequacies or power delivery issues (PSU, motherboard voltage settings), not a faulty CPU.
When a New CPU Might Be Needed:
Physical Damage:

Rare, but possible if the CPU has been run at extreme temps for extended periods. Signs would include frequent crashes even at low loads or visible damage (e.g., burn marks).
Motherboard Socket Issues:

If the CPU pins or motherboard socket are damaged (e.g., bent pins), the connection might cause instability.
Future-Proofing:

If you fix the cooling and it still struggles to run demanding games or apps, an upgrade could be worth considering for better performance—but this would be a choice, not a necessity.
What to Do First:
Fix the Cooling:

Reapply thermal paste, clean the cooler, and check airflow.
If necessary, upgrade to a better cooling solution.
Test Stability After Fixes:

Run Prime95 again after addressing cooling. If it passes (temps stay below 85°C and no restarts), your CPU is fine.
Power Delivery:

If cooling doesn’t fix the problem, we’ll look at your PSU or motherboard settings next.
Let’s focus on the fixes first. Chances are high that your CPU is not the problem—we just need to optimize the system around it. Would you like guidance on the cooling steps?

You said:
It'd not far fetched to consider a new one then, if I bought a £200 one. Think that would help? Or would cooling still be an issue? 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Buying a new CPU for around £200 could help if the current one is defective or significantly underpowered for your needs—but in your case, the Ryzen 5 5600X is already strong enough for Final Fantasy XVI and modern tasks. The problem is more likely due to cooling or power delivery, which would still affect a new CPU if not resolved.

Would a New CPU Solve the Problem?
If Cooling is the Issue:

A new CPU will still overheat if the cooling setup (thermal paste, cooler, airflow) isn’t fixed.
For example, a higher-end CPU (e.g., Ryzen 7 5800X) could generate even more heat, worsening the problem without better cooling.
If the CPU is Faulty:

If your Ryzen 5 5600X has a defect (uncommon but possible), replacing it with a new CPU would fix the problem.
Long-Term Upgrade:

If you want a performance boost, upgrading to a higher-tier CPU for £200–300 (e.g., Ryzen 7 5800X or Ryzen 7 5700X) could be worth it.
However, ensure your cooler can handle it.
Should You Upgrade?
No Upgrade Yet: If the issue is cooling, your current CPU is fine—fixing the cooling will save money and improve stability.
Upgrade Only if Faulty or Needed: If diagnostics confirm your CPU is faulty or you want a performance boost for future-proofing, then a £200 CPU (like Ryzen 7 5700X) could be a solid choice.
What to Do Now:
Focus on fixing cooling first:
Reapply thermal paste.
Upgrade to a better cooler if necessary.
Re-test the system.
If the issue persists after resolving cooling, consider a CPU upgrade.
Let me know how you want to proceed, and I’ll guide you through cooling or help you pick a new CPU if needed!






You said:
Explain to me again, why isn't the stress test running more than 5minutes, bad cooking?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, the reason the stress test isn't running for more than 5 minutes is almost certainly due to bad cooling. Let’s break it down step by step so it’s crystal clear:

1. What’s Happening During the Stress Test
A stress test like Prime95 pushes your CPU to its absolute limit.
This causes your CPU to generate a lot of heat quickly.
Your cooling system (cooler, thermal paste, airflow) is responsible for managing that heat and keeping the CPU below its safe operating temperature (ideally 85°C).
2. Why Your System Fails After 5 Minutes
Your CPU temps climb rapidly to 85–90°C within minutes during the stress test.
This high temperature triggers thermal throttling (where the CPU slows down to cool off) or a safety shutdown to prevent damage.
This is a sign that your cooling system isn’t doing its job effectively:
Thermal paste may be degraded or poorly applied.
The CPU cooler might not be mounted properly.
Your cooler or fans might not be sufficient for sustained high loads.
3. Why It’s Not the CPU Itself (Likely)
A defective CPU would fail even under light loads, not just during a stress test.
Your CPU works fine in normal tasks but overheats during heavy workloads—this points to insufficient cooling, not a faulty CPU.
4. The Role of Cooling
If your CPU can’t stay cool, it doesn’t matter how powerful it is. Fixing the cooling will:

Prevent overheating during stress tests and games.
Restore stability under high loads.
Extend the lifespan of your processor.
Next Steps:
Reapply Thermal Paste: If the paste is old or poorly applied, the CPU can’t transfer heat effectively to the cooler.
Check Cooler Mounting: Ensure it’s properly seated and secure.
Improve Airflow: Clean dust from the case and ensure fans are working.
Upgrade Cooler (if needed): If you’re using a stock cooler, it might not be sufficient for sustained stress.
Would you like guidance on reapplying thermal paste or evaluating your cooling setup? Let me know, and we can tackle this step by step!






You said:
I'm worried that the game is demanding more than 100% of the processor, which is causing the restart, not necessarily the teml. What's happening is, theres a video screen, as it plays it begins to stutter, I saw the temps get to around 85, then it crashes, then it restarts (the computer )
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your concern is valid—there are two main possibilities here: overheating or CPU overload (or both). Based on what you’re describing—video stuttering, temps hitting 85°C, and then a restart—here’s what might be happening step by step:

What’s Likely Happening:
CPU Overload and Stuttering:

When the video plays, the game demands high CPU usage (close to or even maxing at 100%).
The stuttering suggests the CPU can’t keep up, likely due to high load or throttling.
Overheating Triggering a Restart:

The CPU hits 85°C (close to its thermal limit) during the high load.
If temps climb further (above 90°C), the system likely triggers a thermal safety shutdown or crashes due to instability.
Power Supply Strain (Potentially Related):

If the CPU draws a sudden spike in power at 100% load, and the PSU struggles to supply stable power, it can also cause a restart.
Could the Game Demand Over 100% CPU?
No—games (or any software) cannot demand "more than 100%" of a CPU. What happens instead is:

The CPU hits its maximum processing capacity (100% usage).
If the cooling system can’t handle the heat generated, the CPU throttles or the system restarts.
Example:

The game demands more processing power than the CPU can deliver.
The CPU gets hotter as it works harder, reaching unsafe temps (85°C+).
If cooling can’t keep up, the CPU shuts down to protect itself.
Why the Restart Happens:
The video stuttering suggests your CPU is being pushed to its limit, but the restart indicates a hardware safety mechanism.
This could be caused by:
Overheating: Temps above 85°C trigger a shutdown.
Instability Under Load: High CPU usage causes voltage or power delivery issues.
Driver or Game Issue: Faulty drivers or corrupt game files can crash the system.
What to Test Next:
Monitor CPU Usage During the Crash:

Use Task Manager or HWMonitor to see if CPU usage hits 100% consistently before the crash.
If usage spikes to 100% and stays there, it’s likely a CPU overload issue.
Run a Combined Stress Test:

Test CPU + GPU together (Prime95 + FurMark) to simulate game-like conditions.
If the system restarts, it confirms a hardware-related instability (CPU, PSU, or overheating).
Limit CPU Usage in the Game:

Cap the game’s FPS to 60 FPS (via NVIDIA Control Panel).
Reduce settings that are CPU-heavy (shadows, NPC density, resolution).
Reapply Thermal Paste and Optimize Cooling:

Even if the game is stressing the CPU, proper cooling should prevent restarts due to overheating.
Next Step:
Would you like to:

Test CPU usage during the crash?
Run a combined stress test?
Jump straight into cooling fixes?
Let’s narrow this down further!






You said:
So realistically a cpu should never overheat and restart and unless there's an issue with cooling. A cpu should just be able to run at 100% and maintain a highish temperature?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Exactly—a CPU should handle 100% usage indefinitely without overheating or crashing, as long as the cooling system is doing its job properly. If your CPU is restarting or overheating, it’s almost always tied to a cooling or power delivery issue, not the CPU itself.

How a CPU Handles High Usage:
Designed for Sustained 100% Load:

CPUs are built to handle maximum load (e.g., during gaming or stress tests) without crashing.
A properly functioning CPU with adequate cooling should maintain stable temperatures around 70–85°C under 100% load.
Thermal Throttling Before Crashes:

If a CPU gets too hot, it throttles (reduces its clock speed) to cool down.
It only restarts if temperatures exceed critical limits (e.g., 90–100°C) or there’s a hardware fault.
Why a CPU Overheats and Crashes:
Cooling Issues:

Poor thermal paste application.
Inadequate CPU cooler or airflow.
Dust buildup blocking fans or heatsinks.
Power Delivery Issues:

Voltage instability from the motherboard or PSU can cause the CPU to behave unpredictably under load.
Rare Hardware Defects:

A defective CPU can crash under load, but this is rare compared to cooling or power problems.
Why Your CPU is Restarting:
Your Ryzen 5 5600X should handle 100% load without issue, but:

Temps hit ~85°C under load and then your system restarts.
This strongly suggests cooling isn’t keeping up. The CPU is likely hitting its thermal safety limit (around 90–95°C) and triggering a restart to protect itself.
The Bottom Line:
A CPU should not overheat and restart, even at 100% usage. If it does, there’s likely an issue with cooling or power delivery, not the CPU itself.
Fixing cooling (thermal paste, cooler, or airflow) will likely stabilize your system.

You said:
What was my power supply?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your power supply is the Corsair TX750M, which is a 750W semi-modular PSU. It’s a high-quality unit from a reputable brand, and 750W should be more than enough to handle your system with the Ryzen 5 5600X and RTX 3080 Ti.

Why the PSU is Likely Fine:
Sufficient Wattage:

Your setup requires around 550–650W under maximum load, so a 750W PSU gives you headroom.
High-Quality PSU:

The TX750M is rated 80+ Gold, meaning it’s efficient and stable under load.
When the PSU Could Cause Issues:
Age or Wear:

If the PSU is older than 5 years, its components may have degraded, leading to instability under sudden power spikes.
Even high-quality PSUs can weaken over time.
Power Spikes:

When the CPU and GPU both demand peak power (e.g., during gaming), a faulty or aging PSU might fail to provide stable power, causing restarts.
Loose or Improper Connections:

Double-check that both the CPU power cable and GPU power cables are securely connected.
Next Steps:
Since your PSU is good quality and sufficient wattage, the restarts are more likely due to CPU cooling or a power delivery issue (if the PSU is old).
If cooling fixes don’t resolve the issue, we can stress-test the PSU to confirm its stability.
Would you like to focus on cooling first or test the PSU?






You said:
Is a double extension lead something to consider an issue? 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, using a double extension lead could potentially be an issue, especially if it's powering a high-performance system like yours. Here's why:

Why a Double Extension Lead Can Cause Problems:
Voltage Drop:

Extension leads can cause voltage drops, especially if they are long or low-quality.
Your PSU relies on a stable voltage supply, and a drop can lead to power instability or restarts under load.
Overloading the Circuit:

If other devices (like monitors, chargers, etc.) are plugged into the same lead, it could overload the circuit, especially during power spikes from the CPU or GPU.
Increased Resistance:

Each connection in the chain adds resistance, which can reduce the efficiency of power delivery to your PC.
Risk of Electrical Faults:

Double extensions increase the chance of overheating, tripped breakers, or even fires, especially if the leads are low-quality or not rated for high loads.
What to Do:
Plug the PSU Directly Into a Wall Socket:

This eliminates any potential issues caused by the extension lead.
If an Extension is Necessary:

Use a single, high-quality extension lead rated for high wattage (e.g., at least 3000W).
Avoid daisy-chaining (connecting multiple leads).
Test Without the Extension Lead:

Temporarily plug your PC directly into a wall outlet to see if the restarts stop.
Likelihood of Impact:
While it’s less likely to be the main cause, a double extension lead can contribute to power instability. If the problem persists even after fixing cooling, testing the power connection is a quick and worthwhile check. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!






You said:
So really, if I get the stress test to last and temps not go above 85, then it shouldn't crash when I run final fantasy?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Exactly! If you can run a stress test like Prime95 for 10–15 minutes without temps exceeding 85°C and no crashes, then your CPU should handle Final Fantasy XVI without restarts. Here's why:

Why a Successful Stress Test Indicates Stability:
Stress Tests Push Hardware Beyond Typical Gaming Loads:

Prime95 puts your CPU under extreme, unrealistic workloads (much harder than gaming).
If your CPU survives Prime95 without overheating or crashing, it can easily handle real-world gaming loads.
Temperature Stability = No Crashes:

Keeping your CPU temps below 85°C ensures it won’t throttle or hit the critical limits (90–95°C) that trigger restarts.
Stress Tests Simulate Sustained Load:

If Prime95 runs fine, it shows your system is stable under sustained heavy use, meaning Final Fantasy XVI (even with demanding shaders and graphics) should run without triggering a restart.
What This Means for Final Fantasy XVI:
If you fix your cooling to handle the stress test, FFXVI will likely work flawlessly:
It won’t push your CPU as hard as Prime95.
Your temps will likely stay lower than during the stress test, ensuring stability.
Next Step:
Focus on improving cooling:
Reapply thermal paste.
Check cooler mounting and airflow.
Retest with Prime95 after fixes.
If the stress test passes, Final Fantasy XVI should run fine.
Let me know if you want guidance on cooling fixes or how to test the game again!






You said:
Even the stress test didn't crash the system though, even though temps started to spike, I stopped it at 4mins, why does final fantasy all of a sudden restart the system at the same time too 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Great observation! If the stress test didn’t crash the system but Final Fantasy XVI restarts it consistently, it suggests there’s more at play than just CPU overheating. Let’s break down possible reasons why Final Fantasy XVI triggers a restart even when the stress test doesn’t:

1. Combined CPU and GPU Load:
Prime95 stresses only the CPU, but Final Fantasy XVI loads both the CPU and GPU simultaneously.
This creates a power spike that your PSU or motherboard may struggle to handle, especially during transitions like shader compilation or intense cutscenes.
Test:

Run a combined stress test:
Prime95 for the CPU + FurMark for the GPU at the same time.
Monitor temps and stability to see if the system restarts.
2. Power Supply Instability:
If the PSU is struggling to deliver stable power during high combined loads, the system may restart.
This can happen even with a 750W PSU if:
The PSU is aging or has degraded over time.
Power is unevenly distributed across components.
You’re using a double extension lead (which could cause voltage drops).
Test:

Plug the PC directly into the wall socket (bypassing the extension lead) and see if the issue persists.
3. Game-Specific Issue (Drivers or Software):
Final Fantasy XVI might expose instability in your GPU drivers, DirectX, or even the game files.
Stuttering during the cutscene suggests a potential software conflict.
Fix:

Reinstall the GPU drivers using a clean install (via Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)).
Verify the game files through Steam/Epic Games Launcher.
4. Thermal or Load Spike Timing:
Final Fantasy XVI might create a sudden load or temperature spike that Prime95 doesn’t.
For example:
During cutscenes or graphics rendering, the GPU starts working harder, raising temps for both the CPU and GPU in quick succession.
This spike might hit critical limits (e.g., CPU hitting 90°C) before cooling can catch up.
Fix:

Focus on cooling (reapply thermal paste, improve airflow) to handle any sudden temperature spikes.
5. Motherboard or BIOS Instability:
Your BIOS might have unstable settings for voltage or power delivery.
Sudden power demands from the CPU and GPU combined could trigger a restart.
Fix:

Update your motherboard’s BIOS to the latest version.
Check BIOS settings for CPU voltage or power limits and ensure they’re not overly aggressive.
Why This Happens at the Same Time:
Final Fantasy XVI likely triggers a consistent load scenario:
Shader compilation and cutscene rendering stress both the CPU and GPU.
If cooling, power delivery, or drivers are unstable, this exact point can cause a crash every time.
Next Step:
Would you like to:

Test with Prime95 + FurMark to simulate combined CPU and GPU load?
Reapply thermal paste to rule out cooling spikes?
Focus on PSU or driver troubleshooting?
We’ll narrow this down step by step!

You said:
Before I try to clean the CPU, isn't there a way to force apps to close when CPU temps are too high?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, there are ways to automatically force apps to close when CPU temperatures exceed safe limits, which can help prevent crashes or restarts. While this is not a permanent fix for cooling issues, it can be a temporary safeguard.

Options to Force Close Apps at High CPU Temps:
1. Use MSI Afterburner or HWInfo with Custom Alerts:
These tools can monitor CPU temps and trigger actions (like killing apps) when thresholds are exceeded.
Steps:

Open MSI Afterburner or HWInfo (with RTSS).
Configure a temp limit alert:
If CPU temps exceed 85°C, it can send a system alert.
Pair this with a script to terminate specific apps using tools like Taskkill (explained below).
2. Set Up a Task Scheduler Script (Windows):
You can write a script to monitor CPU temperature and automatically close apps.
Steps:

Write a script (e.g., with PowerShell):

powershell
Copy code
$tempLimit = 85
$currentTemp = Get-WmiObject MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature -Namespace "root/wmi" |
               Select-Object -ExpandProperty CurrentTemperature
$currentTempCelsius = ($currentTemp - 2732) / 10
if ($currentTempCelsius -gt $tempLimit) {
    Stop-Process -Name "GameProcessName" -Force
}
Replace "GameProcessName" with the name of the process (e.g., ff16.exe).

Use Task Scheduler:

Run the script at regular intervals (e.g., every 1 minute).
3. Install Third-Party Software:
Apps like Core Temp or OpenHardwareMonitor allow you to monitor temperatures and pair them with actions like shutting down apps.
Example: Core Temp with Overheat Protection:

Download Core Temp.
Go to Options > Overheat Protection.
Set a temperature threshold and action:
Choose Execute a File to trigger a script or app closure.
4. Last Resort: Throttle CPU Power (BIOS or Software):
Reduce the CPU’s max power so it doesn’t hit critical temps.
In Windows:
Go to Power Settings > Advanced Power Options.
Set Maximum Processor State to 90% (this lowers performance but keeps temps down).
Why Fix Cooling Anyway?
While forcing apps to close can prevent crashes, it’s only a temporary workaround. Properly fixing the CPU overheating issue ensures long-term stability and allows your system to run at full capacity without interruptions.

Right, we're onto the clean job, fan off, I can see the old thermal on it, what's next 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Great, you're making progress! Here’s the next step-by-step guide to properly clean and reapply thermal paste:

1. Gather Your Tools:
Make sure you have:

Isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher is ideal).
A lint-free cloth or coffee filters (these won’t leave residue).
A small flat tool (like a plastic card) if the thermal paste is thick.
New thermal paste (e.g., Arctic MX-4 or Noctua NT-H1).
2. Clean the Old Thermal Paste:
Remove Bulk Paste:

Use a lint-free cloth or paper towel to wipe off the majority of the old paste from both:
The CPU surface.
The base of the cooler (the part that touches the CPU).
Be gentle to avoid scratching the surfaces.
Clean Residue:

Apply a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to the cloth or coffee filter.
Gently wipe the CPU and cooler until all residue is gone and the surfaces are shiny and clean.
If needed, use a cotton swab dipped in alcohol to clean edges or corners.
Let It Dry:

Alcohol evaporates quickly, but wait 1-2 minutes to ensure everything is completely dry.
3. Apply New Thermal Paste:
Dot Method (Recommended):
Squeeze a small pea-sized dot of thermal paste in the center of the CPU.
This will spread evenly when the cooler is mounted.
Avoid Overuse:
Too much thermal paste can reduce effectiveness and make a mess.
Aim for a layer just thick enough to fill microscopic gaps between the CPU and cooler.
4. Reattach the Cooler:
Position Cooler Properly:

Align the cooler with the mounting brackets.
Make sure it’s flat and evenly placed on the CPU.
Secure the Screws:

Tighten the screws diagonally (in a crisscross pattern) to apply even pressure.
Don’t overtighten; just ensure it’s firmly secured.
5. Reconnect the Fan:
Reconnect the CPU fan cable to the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.
6. Test the System:
Power the system back on.
Run a light stress test or game to check if temps improve.
Monitor temps with HWMonitor or Core Temp:
Idle: 30–40°C
Load: 60–85°C
Let me know how it goes or if you hit any issues!






You said:
Should I take the CPU off?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You don’t need to remove the CPU from its socket unless there’s a specific issue with its placement or you see old thermal paste that has spread onto the motherboard or pins.

When to Leave the CPU in Place:
If the thermal paste is only on the top of the CPU (where it’s supposed to be), it’s better to leave the CPU in its socket to avoid unnecessary handling or damage.
When to Remove the CPU:
Paste on the Sides or Pins:

If old thermal paste has seeped onto the sides or pins of the CPU, you’ll need to clean it thoroughly. This is rare unless paste was applied excessively before.
Checking for Dust or Alignment Issues:

If you suspect there’s dust or debris underneath the CPU, or if you’ve had stability issues unrelated to temps, it might be worth reseating it.
Switching to a New Cooler or CPU:

If you’re upgrading your cooler or CPU, you’ll obviously need to remove it.
How to Safely Remove the CPU (If Needed):
Release the Locking Arm:

Gently lift the locking arm on the CPU socket to release the CPU.
Lift the CPU Carefully:

Pick it up by the edges—don’t touch the pins or pads underneath.
Clean Thermal Paste:

If necessary, clean the sides or underside of the CPU with a cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol.
Reinsert the CPU:

Ensure the gold triangle on the CPU aligns with the triangle on the socket.
Lower it gently into place and lock it with the arm.
My Recommendation:
If there’s no mess outside the CPU surface, leave it in place. Cleaning and reapplying thermal paste to the surface is usually all that’s needed. Let me know if you notice anything unusual, and I can guide you further!

ChatGPT
Great work! Now that everything is reassembled, let’s test your system to ensure the reapplication of thermal paste has improved your CPU temps and stability.

Steps to Test the System:
1. Boot and Monitor Temps at Idle:
Power on your PC and let it sit at the desktop for 5–10 minutes.
Use HWMonitor, Core Temp, or a similar tool to check idle CPU temperatures:
Ideal Idle Temps: Between 30–40°C.
If idle temps are high (50°C+), it might indicate an issue with the cooler installation.
2. Run a Light Stress Test (5–10 Minutes):
Use a program like Cinebench R23 to test your CPU under load:
Download Cinebench here.
Run a single Multi-Core test.
Monitor CPU temps during the test:
Acceptable Load Temps: 70–85°C.
If temps spike above 85°C, stop the test and recheck the cooler mounting.
3. Run Prime95 (Optional):
If temps are stable after Cinebench, test with Prime95 Blend Test:
Run the test for 10–15 minutes.
Monitor temps and system stability:
Temps should stay below 85°C.
Ensure the system doesn’t throttle, crash, or restart.
4. Test Final Fantasy XVI:
If stress tests pass, launch Final Fantasy XVI and monitor temps while playing.
Watch for:
Smooth performance with no crashes or restarts.
CPU temps staying below 85°C during gameplay.
Tools You’ll Need:
HWMonitor or Core Temp for monitoring temperatures.
Cinebench R23 or Prime95 for stress testing.
Let me know how the tests go or if you encounter any issues along the way!

Going for the prime test 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Good call! Running Prime95 will give you a solid idea of whether the CPU is stable after the cleaning and reapplication of thermal paste. Here’s how to proceed:

How to Run Prime95:
Download and Install Prime95:

Prime95 Official Site.
Choose the version appropriate for your operating system.
Run Prime95:

Open the program and select Just Stress Testing.
Choose the Blend Test:
This tests both the CPU and memory, similar to real-world conditions.
Monitor Temps:

Open HWMonitor or another temperature-monitoring tool.
Watch the CPU Package Temp and Core Temps:
Safe Temps: Below 85°C.
If temps spike above 90°C, stop the test immediately.
Let It Run for 10–15 Minutes:

Observe:
If the system restarts or crashes, cooling or power issues remain.
If the CPU stays stable under load and temps stay under control, the issue is resolved.
What to Look For:
Stable Temps: CPU temps below 85°C.
No Crashes: The system should not restart or freeze.
Smooth Performance: No stuttering or throttling (CPU clock speeds dropping significantly).
Let me know how the test goes! If it passes, we’ll move on to testing Final Fantasy XVI to confirm the fix.






You said:
4 minutes in, it looks like it's at 89 degrees 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your CPU temps hit 89°C just 4 minutes into Prime95, the cooling system is still struggling to keep the processor cool under heavy load. While it's just below the Ryzen 5600X's thermal safety limit (~90-95°C), this is too close for comfort, especially for long-term stability.

What This Tells Us:
The Cooling Issue Persists:

Your reapplication of thermal paste helped stabilize the CPU somewhat (since it hasn’t crashed immediately), but it's not cooling efficiently enough for sustained stress.
Prime95 is a Worst-Case Scenario:

Remember, Prime95 pushes your CPU harder than most real-world workloads (like gaming). If the system doesn't crash now, Final Fantasy XVI might still run fine. However, it's safer to address the high temps.
Immediate Fixes to Lower Temps:
1. Ensure Cooler is Properly Secured:
Double-check the cooler is firmly mounted, with even pressure applied across the CPU.
2. Increase Fan Speeds:
Go into your BIOS and set the CPU fan to Turbo Mode or create a more aggressive fan curve.
If you're using software like Fan Control, manually increase the RPM of the CPU fan.
3. Improve Case Airflow:
Ensure case fans are:
Pulling in cool air (intake at the front/bottom).
Pushing out hot air (exhaust at the rear/top).
Clean dust filters or open the case temporarily to see if airflow improves temps.
4. Limit Power to the CPU:
Reduce the CPU’s power consumption to lower heat output:
In BIOS, lower the PPT (Package Power Tracking) or set a power limit.
Alternatively, limit CPU max performance in Windows:
Go to Power Settings > Advanced Power Settings.
Set Maximum Processor State to 90%.
What to Do Next:
Try these adjustments to improve cooling.
If you’re stuck at 89°C in Prime95, retest Final Fantasy XVI directly to see how it handles (it won’t stress the CPU as much as Prime95).
Let me know if you'd like help with any specific step!






You said:
I'm monitor the prime test again 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Good call! Monitoring Prime95 again will help confirm if the situation improves or if the temps remain high. While you're watching, here’s what to track and consider:

Key Things to Monitor:
CPU Temps (via HWMonitor or similar):

Watch the Package Temp and individual Core Temps.
Safe Range: Below 85°C under load.
If temps hit or exceed 90°C, stop the test immediately.
Clock Speeds:

Ensure your CPU isn’t throttling. Check HWMonitor for consistent core speeds (e.g., 4.2 GHz or higher).
Throttling occurs when the CPU reduces its clock speeds to lower temps, which indicates a cooling issue.
Stability:

Observe for crashes, restarts, or freezes during the test.
If the test continues for 10–15 minutes without issues, it’s a good sign.
If Temps Exceed 90°C:
Stop the Test: Protect your CPU from unnecessary stress.
Focus on cooling fixes (increase fan speeds, improve airflow, or adjust power limits in BIOS).
Let me know how it goes this time. If the CPU stabilizes and the test runs fine, we’ll move on to testing Final Fantasy XVI!






You said:
Where do I see code speeds 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To check CPU clock speeds while running Prime95, you can use HWMonitor or a similar tool like CPU-Z. Here’s how to find it:

In HWMonitor:
Open HWMonitor while running Prime95.
Scroll down to your CPU (AMD Ryzen 5 5600X) section.
Look for the column labeled Clocks (MHz):
It shows the current speeds of each core in MHz (e.g., 4200 MHz = 4.2 GHz).
All cores should be running at or near their maximum boost speed under Prime95 load.
In CPU-Z:
Download and install CPU-Z from here.
Open CPU-Z during the Prime95 test.
Go to the CPU tab.
Look at the Core Speed field (updated in real-time).
This will show the clock speed your CPU is running at during the test.
What to Look For:
Stable Speeds:
Ryzen 5 5600X should run at 4.2–4.6 GHz under load, depending on your cooling and BIOS settings.
Throttling:
If speeds drop significantly (e.g., below 3.5 GHz) while temps rise, the CPU is throttling due to overheating.
Let me know what speeds you see! It’s a key indicator of whether your CPU is running at full performance or being limited by heat.






You said:
When the worker starts from prime. Temps are at 95
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If Prime95 temps immediately hit 95°C when the workers start, your CPU is overheating, and the system is dangerously close to thermal shutdown. This confirms that the cooling issue hasn’t been fully resolved, and the CPU cannot handle the stress.

Why This is Happening:
Cooling System is Inadequate:

Thermal paste application might still not be optimal, or the cooler itself may not be sufficient for sustained heavy loads.
Fan speeds or airflow may not be keeping up with the heat output.
Prime95 is Extremely Demanding:

It stresses your CPU far beyond normal workloads (games like Final Fantasy XVI are less demanding), but this is still a red flag.
Potential Cooler Issue:

The CPU cooler might not be installed properly, isn’t powerful enough, or has degraded over time.
Immediate Actions to Take:
Stop Prime95:

To protect your CPU, stop the test immediately when temps hit 95°C.
Double-Check the Cooler:

Make sure the cooler is securely and evenly seated on the CPU.
Confirm that the fan is spinning at high speeds (check in BIOS or software like HWMonitor).
Increase Fan Speeds:

Go to your BIOS and set the fan to Turbo Mode or create an aggressive fan curve.
Improve Airflow:

Temporarily run your PC with the side panel off to see if this lowers temps.
Test Again with Lighter Load:

Run Cinebench R23 instead of Prime95. It’s less extreme and gives a more realistic view of gaming loads.
Monitor temps to see if they stay below 85°C.
Next Steps:
If temps still spike:

Reapply Thermal Paste Again: Use a very small, even amount.
Consider Cooler Upgrade: If you’re using a stock cooler, it may not be sufficient. Upgrading to a high-performance air cooler (e.g., Noctua NH-U12S) or an AIO liquid cooler could solve the problem.
Let me know if you’d like to troubleshoot the cooler further or explore an upgrade!






You said:
I've let prime run and the temperatures have stabilised after the worker started, temps spike when the test starts, up to 95 but then drop once they get into the test 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the temperatures spike to 95°C at the start of Prime95 but then stabilize at lower temps, this is a promising sign. The initial spike is caused by the sudden full-load stress when the workers start. However, if temps stabilize below 85°C during sustained testing, your CPU can likely handle heavy workloads (including gaming).

What This Means:
Initial Spikes are Normal:

A brief temp spike to 95°C during Prime95’s startup phase is common, as all CPU cores are hit with a sudden full workload.
The stabilization afterward shows that your cooling system is working under sustained load.
Cooling May Still Be Marginal:

While the temps stabilize, the fact that it spikes to 95°C initially means your cooler is just barely keeping up.
For long-term reliability, reducing those initial spikes and keeping sustained temps lower is ideal.
What to Check:
Stable Temps Under Load:

Monitor temps during the sustained test. If they stay below 85–90°C, it’s acceptable.
If temps frequently hover near 90–95°C, you’re still close to the limit.
Sustained Stability:

Let Prime95 run for 10–15 minutes.
If the system doesn’t crash or throttle (check core speeds in HWMonitor), it’s a good sign.
Recommendations:
If Temps Stay High but Stable:

Increase fan speeds or improve airflow to reduce spikes.
Consider limiting CPU power slightly in the BIOS (PPT or power limits).
If Prime95 Runs Fine, Test Final Fantasy XVI:

If temps stabilize during Prime95, the CPU will likely handle Final Fantasy XVI, as it won’t push the CPU as hard.
Next Step:
What are the stabilized temps now after a few minutes in the test? If they’re good, let’s move on to testing Final Fantasy XVI to see if the restart issue is resolved. Let me know!






You said:
I'm trying to see core speeds. I see powers, currents, clocks,voltages 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you’re looking to monitor core speeds during the Prime95 test in HWMonitor, here’s exactly where to find them:

How to Find Core Speeds in HWMonitor:
Scroll to the CPU Section:

Look for "AMD Ryzen 5 5600X" in HWMonitor.
Check the Clocks Section:

Under the CPU section, there will be a subcategory labeled Clocks (MHz).
You should see individual clock speeds for each core (e.g., Core 0, Core 1, etc.).
Look for Real-Time Updates:

The values update in real-time, showing the current speeds of each core.
Normal under load: Each core should run close to its boost clock (around 4.2–4.6 GHz) during the test.
If You Can’t Find Core Speeds in HWMonitor:
Use CPU-Z (Quick and Simple):

Download CPU-Z from here.
Open the program and go to the CPU tab.
Look at the Core Speed field—this shows the current clock speed of the CPU.
In BIOS (Optional):

Some motherboards display real-time clock speeds in the BIOS hardware monitor.
What to Look For:
Stable Speeds:
Under Prime95, clock speeds should stay close to boost speeds (e.g., 4.2–4.6 GHz).
Throttling:
If speeds drop significantly (e.g., below 3.5 GHz) during the test, it means the CPU is throttling due to heat.
Let me know if you see stable clock speeds, or if the CPU appears to be throttling!






You said:
There at 3900 ATM 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your CPU core speeds are at 3900 MHz (3.9 GHz) during the Prime95 test, this suggests thermal throttling is occurring. Your Ryzen 5 5600X should ideally be running closer to its boost clock speeds (4.2–4.6 GHz) under load.

Why This Happens:
Thermal Throttling:

The CPU lowers its clock speeds when temperatures get too high (around 90–95°C) to protect itself.
This explains why your temps spiked initially to 95°C and why the clock speeds have settled at 3.9 GHz.
Power or Voltage Limitations (Less Likely):

If the CPU isn’t receiving enough power or is undervolted, it can run at reduced speeds. However, your high temps point more toward throttling than power issues.
What This Means:
Your Cooling System is Inadequate for Prime95:

The fact that temps spike to 95°C and clock speeds throttle shows that your cooler isn’t fully keeping up with the CPU’s heat output.
Real-World Workloads May Be Fine:

Games like Final Fantasy XVI won’t push your CPU as hard as Prime95, so you may not see throttling in those cases.
However, the fact that it restarts during FFXVI shows your cooling is borderline even for gaming loads.
Immediate Recommendations:
Focus on Cooling Improvements:

Increase Fan Speeds: Go into the BIOS or use software to create an aggressive fan curve.
Improve Case Airflow: Check intake/exhaust fan setup and clean filters.
Test in a Real-World Scenario:

Stop Prime95 and test Final Fantasy XVI directly. Monitor CPU temps and clock speeds during gameplay to see if the problem persists.
Consider Cooler Upgrade:

If the issue persists, upgrading to a better cooler (like a Noctua NH-D15 or a 240mm AIO liquid cooler) will give you more headroom for high loads.
Next Step:
Would you like to test Final Fantasy XVI now or explore further cooling optimizations? Let me know!






You said:
It's running at that with temps now at least than 80 stilling running the test 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your CPU is running at 3.9 GHz with temps below 80°C during the Prime95 test, that's a positive sign—your cooling is now handling the heat much better than before. However, the reduced clock speed still suggests some form of power or thermal throttling might be active, but it’s not hitting critical temperatures anymore.

What This Means:
Stable Temps but Reduced Performance:

The CPU is staying cool under load, which shows that your cooler is now sufficient for handling the heat.
However, the clock speeds being stuck at 3.9 GHz instead of boosting to 4.2–4.6 GHz suggests either:
Power Limits: Your motherboard might be capping the CPU’s power.
BIOS/Voltage Settings: Default settings could be conservative.
No Immediate Danger:

Since the temps are under control, this isn’t a critical issue for gaming or day-to-day tasks. You’ve already resolved the overheating problem.
Recommendations:
Check Power and Boost Settings in BIOS:

Restart your PC and enter the BIOS/UEFI.
Look for settings like PPT (Package Power Tracking), ECO Mode, or AMD Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO).
Ensure:
PPT Limit is set to default or higher.
PBO is enabled for full performance.
Test Gaming Performance:

Stop Prime95 and test Final Fantasy XVI to see how it performs:
Monitor temps (should stay below 85°C).
Watch for clock speeds—if they’re close to 3.9 GHz, it’s sufficient for gaming.
Reassess Need for Further Tuning:

If the game runs smoothly without crashes or restarts, you can leave things as they are.
If the CPU still struggles with high loads, tweaking BIOS settings or upgrading the cooler might be necessary.
Would you like guidance on checking BIOS settings, or should we move to testing the game? Let me know!






You said:
Can't I over clock?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can definitely overclock your Ryzen 5 5600X, but it's worth noting that overclocking can increase heat output and power consumption, which could worsen the overheating or stability issues if your cooling isn't fully sorted yet. However, with proper tuning, you might achieve a stable overclock that improves performance.

What Overclocking Can Do:
Increase Clock Speeds:

You can push your CPU to consistently run at a higher clock speed than the base or boost clocks.
Example: Instead of 3.9 GHz, you might achieve 4.4–4.6 GHz on all cores.
More Control Over Performance:

Overclocking lets you bypass conservative BIOS settings, ensuring better performance.
Considerations:

Overclocking increases heat, so you’ll need to monitor temps carefully.
Stability testing is essential after every change.
Should You Overclock Now?
Yes, if:
Temps are now stable under load (as they seem to be with your Prime95 test at ~80°C).
You’re comfortable tweaking





You said:
No more spikes, they're consistent temps below 80. I just don't think I've changed much, I think yesterday I just didn't run it long enough, I can test final fantasy again now to see. If it still doesn't work, what are my options?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
Testing Final Fantasy XVI now is a good idea, especially since your CPU temps are stable under Prime95. If it still restarts, here are the likely culprits and your next steps:

If Final Fantasy XVI Still Restarts:
Power Supply Issues:

The PSU may struggle to handle combined CPU and GPU loads during gaming.
Try plugging directly into a wall socket (not a double extension lead).
Test the PSU Stability: Use tools like OCCT or HWMonitor to check power delivery under load.
GPU Drivers:

If the GPU isn’t handling game loads properly, it could trigger a restart.
Next Step: Use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) to cleanly reinstall your GPU drivers.
Game-Specific Issue:

Corrupted game files or a bug might be causing the issue.
Next Step: Verify integrity of game files (Steam/Epic Games Launcher) or reinstall the game.
Combined Load Issue (Thermal or Power):

Prime95 tests only the CPU, but gaming stresses both CPU and GPU together.
Next Step: Run a Prime95 + FurMark test to simulate combined load. If the system restarts here, it’s likely a PSU issue.
Options If It Still Fails:
Upgrade Cooling:
If temps creep too high during gameplay, consider a better CPU cooler.
Replace PSU:
If power instability is confirmed, a new PSU with 850W or higher would resolve this.
Downclock the CPU:
Temporarily lower the CPU’s boost clock to see if stability improves (reduce heat and power demands).
Let me know how the game test goes, and we’ll decide the next step!






You said:
I'll try final fantasy again. 

Right, it's at the compiling shaders bit, temps around 84. 4.4mhz
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
That’s a promising start! With temps at 84°C and the CPU running at 4.4 GHz, it’s operating at near-optimal performance during the shader compilation phase. Shader compilation is CPU-intensive, so this is the first major hurdle.

What to Watch For:
Temps:

Under 85°C is fine, but if temps creep higher (closer to 90°C), you might encounter instability.
Spikes beyond 95°C would likely trigger a restart.
Stability:

If the system makes it past shader compilation and into gameplay without restarting, it’s a good sign that your CPU and cooling are handling the load.
Clock Speeds:

If the CPU stays consistent at 4.4 GHz, it’s not throttling. Any sudden drops (e.g., below 3.9 GHz) could indicate throttling.
If It Restarts Again:
If the system restarts, we’ll need to focus on:
Power delivery issues (PSU, motherboard).
GPU-related instability (drivers or hardware).
Let me know how it handles the next phase—does it make it past shader compilation into gameplay?






You said:
It got passed this part last time. It's when I first start the game into a cut scene 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Ah, so the issue happens during the first cutscene, where the game transitions into rendering graphics and CPU+GPU workloads combine. That’s a classic moment where power, heat, or driver issues could trigger a restart. Let’s focus on what’s happening during this phase:

Why it Crashes at the Cutscene:
Combined CPU+GPU Load:

Shader compilation stresses the CPU, but cutscenes bring the GPU into play alongside the CPU.
If the PSU or cooling can’t handle the sudden spike in load, the system restarts.
Power Spike from GPU:

GPUs like the RTX 3080 Ti can draw a lot of power during intense scenes.
If the PSU is unstable or not supplying enough power, the system will restart.
Driver/Software Issues:

A driver conflict or game bug during the transition to a cutscene might cause instability.
What to Do if It Crashes:
1. Monitor Temps and Clock Speeds:
Keep HWMonitor running during the cutscene.
Check:
CPU Temps: Do they spike above 90°C before the crash?
GPU Temps and Power Draw: Is the GPU overloading or overheating?
2. Run a Combined Load Test:
Use Prime95 (CPU) + FurMark (GPU) simultaneously to simulate cutscene-like loads.
If the system restarts, it’s likely a PSU issue.
3. Reinstall GPU Drivers (if temps are fine):
Use DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) to perform a clean reinstall of NVIDIA drivers.
Download the latest drivers from NVIDIA’s site.
4. Lower Graphics Settings:
Turn all graphics settings to minimum before retrying the cutscene.
If it works, the issue might be tied to GPU load or power spikes.
Next Steps:
Let’s see if it gets through the cutscene this time. If it restarts:

Report CPU/GPU temps and power usage.
Decide whether to test the PSU or address GPU drivers/settings.
Let me know what happens!






You said:
Right let's outline the next steps then 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s a clear plan to tackle the issue step by step. We’ll aim to isolate the cause (cooling, power, or software) and find a solution:

1. Test Final Fantasy XVI Again
Retry the cutscene phase while monitoring:
CPU Temps: Should stay below 85°C (90°C max briefly).
GPU Temps: Below 85°C is ideal.
Power Draw: Check HWMonitor for spikes in GPU wattage (300–350W is normal for RTX 3080 Ti).
If it restarts, note whether temps spike, clocks drop, or the crash is sudden.
2. Combined CPU+GPU Stress Test
Run Prime95 (CPU) + FurMark (GPU) simultaneously:
Monitor system temps and power usage.
If the system restarts:
It points to power instability (likely PSU-related).
If it doesn’t restart:
The issue might be specific to Final Fantasy XVI (drivers, game files).
3. Reinstall GPU Drivers
Use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) to cleanly reinstall your NVIDIA drivers:
Boot into Safe Mode.
Use DDU to remove all NVIDIA driver files.
Reinstall the latest drivers from NVIDIA’s site.
4. Lower Graphics Settings
Before the cutscene, set Final Fantasy XVI graphics to the lowest:
Resolution: 1080p.
Shadows, Textures, Effects: Low or Off.
Ray Tracing: Off.
This reduces load on the GPU and PSU during transitions.
5. Test Power Supply
If all else fails, the PSU might be unable to handle combined CPU+GPU loads:
Plug the PC directly into the wall (no extension leads).
Replace with a higher-wattage PSU (e.g., 850W Gold-rated PSU like Corsair RM850x).
Step-by-Step Execution:
Test Final Fantasy XVI now with monitoring tools open.
If it restarts, move to the combined Prime95 + FurMark test.
Reinstall GPU drivers and try again.
If still unstable, focus on the PSU or cooling improvements.
Let me know where you want to start, and we’ll go from there!






You said:
I'm surprised it's using next to 100% of my processor, is this normal considering my processor?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It’s unusual for Final Fantasy XVI to push your Ryzen 5 5600X to near 100% CPU usage during gameplay or cutscenes. Your processor is modern and powerful enough to handle most workloads efficiently, so this behavior could indicate:

Why the CPU Usage Might Be So High:
Shader Compilation Phase:

This phase is CPU-intensive and can push usage close to 100%. However, this load should drop significantly once the game starts rendering graphics.
Unoptimized Game Code:

Some games are poorly optimized, offloading too much work onto the CPU instead of the GPU.
Background Processes:

Other tasks or apps (like overlays, updates, or antivirus) running in the background could inflate CPU usage.
Thermal Throttling:

If the CPU is running hot, it might lower clock speeds, forcing it to work harder to maintain performance.
Bottlenecking:

The RTX 3080 Ti is a very powerful GPU, and if your CPU can’t feed it data quickly enough, the CPU might hit 100% while the GPU is underutilized (e.g., 25–50%).
Is 100% Usage Normal for Your CPU?
Briefly (Yes):

During intense scenes (e.g., cutscenes or shader compilation), the CPU can spike to 100%.
For demanding games like FFXVI, this might happen occasionally, but it should not stay constant.
Sustained (No):

If your CPU is consistently at or near 100%, it suggests the game is relying too heavily on the CPU.
How to Diagnose and Fix:
Monitor CPU and GPU Usage:

During gameplay, check Task Manager or HWMonitor:
CPU Usage: Should ideally hover around 50–75% during gameplay, not near 100%.
GPU Usage: Should be higher (80–99%) if the game is GPU-bound.
Reduce CPU Load:

Lower CPU-intensive settings like:
Shadows.
Physics effects.
NPC density.
Enable V-Sync or cap FPS to 60, reducing CPU/GPU work.
Check Background Processes:

Open Task Manager and look for apps consuming CPU cycles (e.g., antivirus, overlays like Discord/Steam).
Test for Bottleneck:

If your CPU usage is at 100% while GPU usage is low, it’s a bottleneck. Upgrading to a Ryzen 7 or tweaking settings can balance the load.
Summary:
100% CPU usage briefly (e.g., during shaders or cutscenes) is normal.
Sustained 100% usage, however, isn’t normal for your Ryzen 5 5600X, especially in this game.
Let me know what you observe during gameplay, and we can pinpoint if it’s a bottleneck, background task, or game issue!






You said:
Well it's actually working, I guess, I should just continue? Ice changed the settings up to high top, it'll be interesting to see how it copes in the next high intense cut scene. Memory is at 70% currently while just having the game paused 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
That’s great news! It’s definitely worth continuing and observing how it handles the next high-intensity moment. With memory at 70%, you’re within a comfortable range for now, so it’s more about monitoring CPU and GPU behavior as the scene ramps up.

Keep an eye on:

CPU temps and usage (should stay below 85°C and around 50–80% during gameplay).
Memory usage (ensure it doesn’t max out at 100%).
Overall stability during the demanding scenes.
Let me know how it goes and if any issues crop up!






You said:
I'm thinking of restarting the game to see how it copes, but will I need to wait the hefty compiling shaders bit?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
No, you shouldn’t have to wait for the shader compilation process again unless the game detects a significant change in your hardware or settings. Here’s how it works:

When Shader Compilation Happens:
First Launch:
The game compiles shaders during the first launch or after major updates.
Hardware/Driver Changes:
If you update your GPU drivers or make significant hardware changes (like a new CPU or GPU), the shaders might recompile.
Graphics Settings Tweaks:
Minor changes (like switching textures to high/low) usually won’t trigger recompilation, but big changes like toggling ray tracing or resolution scaling might.
Test Restarting the Game:
Restarting the game after the initial shader compilation should skip or significantly reduce the wait time.
If the game does decide to recompile, it may only be for the modified settings.
Go ahead and restart the game! If it does recompile, it’s likely due to a settings tweak. Let me know how it handles the restart and whether it skips the lengthy process.






You said:
By this recent little hurdle though, it's apparent I may need to upgrade my system? Is there a way for me to see GPU/CPU usage as a toggle in game instead of having to go to the task manager?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, it’s a good idea to monitor your GPU/CPU usage in-game directly without needing Task Manager. There are tools for this, and most are easy to toggle on and off. Let’s break it down:

How to Monitor GPU/CPU Usage In-Game:
1. NVIDIA GeForce Experience Overlay (Built-In Option)
If you have GeForce Experience installed:

Press Alt + Z to open the overlay while in-game.
Go to Settings > HUD Layout > Performance.
Choose the type of data to display (Basic or Advanced Performance Metrics).
Toggle FPS, CPU, GPU Usage, and Temperatures.
This overlay will appear on-screen while you play.

2. MSI Afterburner (Most Customizable Option)

Check if RivaTuner is running (blue monitor icon in the system tray).
Ensure Application Detection Level is set to High for your game.
Test Another Game:

Sometimes specific games block certain overlays—testing another game will confirm if the issue is game-specific.
Switch to GeForce Experience:

If MSI still doesn’t show the desired metrics, the GeForce Experience overlay can easily display CPU/GPU usage, temps, and FPS.
Let me know if this helps, or if you'd like simpler alternatives like GeForce Experience!






You said:
Okay got it, what are the things that I should look for?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Great! Now that you’ve got the MSI Afterburner overlay working, here’s what you should monitor during gameplay to diagnose and optimize your system performance:

Key Metrics to Watch
1. CPU Usage:
What’s Normal:
50–80% usage is typical during gaming.
Temporary spikes to 100% are okay but shouldn’t be sustained.
What to Watch For:
Constant 90–100% usage: Indicates the CPU is maxed out, potentially bottlenecking the GPU.
High CPU usage with low GPU usage often signals a CPU bottleneck.
2. GPU Usage:
What’s Normal:
80–99% during graphically intense scenes (e.g., cutscenes).
What to Watch For:
Below 50% usage: The GPU isn’t being fully utilized, possibly due to a CPU bottleneck or game settings limiting its workload.
3. CPU Temperature:
What’s Normal:
Idle: 30–40°C.
Under load (gaming): 70–85°C.
Spikes above 90°C can cause throttling or instability.
What to Watch For:
Sustained temps above 90°C during gameplay indicate cooling issues.
4. GPU Temperature:
What’s Normal:
Idle: 30–45°C.
Under load: 70–85°C.
What to Watch For:
Sustained temps above 85°C can lead to GPU throttling or instability.
Fans not spinning or slow to ramp up could indicate a cooling issue.
5. Memory (RAM) Usage:
What’s Normal:
8–12 GB for modern games at high settings.
What to Watch For:
Close to 100% usage: Can cause stuttering, slowdowns, or crashes.
If you’re using close to 16GB, consider reducing in-game settings like textures or upgrading RAM.
6. FPS (Frames Per Second):
What’s Normal:
Smooth gameplay at 60 FPS or higher.
What to Watch For:
Sudden FPS drops or stuttering may point to bottlenecks (CPU, GPU, or RAM).
Red Flags That Need Attention
High CPU Usage (90–100%) with Low GPU Usage (<50%):

Indicates a CPU bottleneck.
Solution: Lower CPU-intensive settings like shadows, physics, or NPC density.
GPU Usage Below 80% During Intense Scenes:

Could signal the GPU isn’t fully utilized, or the game is CPU-bound.
Temps Exceeding Safe Limits:

CPU above 90°C or GPU above 85°C requires better cooling or a hardware check.
RAM Usage Close to 100%:

Can cause stutters or crashes if your system runs out of available memory.
Next Steps During Gameplay
Monitor these metrics during a demanding scene (e.g., a cutscene or combat).
After playing, review:
Are temps staying in the safe range?
Is CPU or GPU maxing out?
Is RAM usage close to 100%?

You said:
Are the cutsscenes limited to 30fps?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, in Final Fantasy XVI, many cutscenes are locked at 30 frames per second (FPS), even if your gameplay runs at higher frame rates. This design choice aims to provide a cinematic experience during story sequences. 
HARDCORE GAMER

However, some players find the transition between higher frame rates during gameplay and the 30 FPS cutscenes to be jarring. To address this, mods are available that unlock the frame rate cap for cutscenes, allowing them to run at the same frame rate as gameplay. One such mod is FFXVIFix, which removes the 30 FPS cap in cutscenes. 
PRIMA GAMES

If you're interested in modifying the game's frame rate settings, here's a video guide that walks you through the process:


Keep in mind that using mods can sometimes affect game stability or performance, and may not be officially supported by the game developers. Always back up your game files before making any modifications.

I can't really play any higher than the 2500x1400. GPU is being stretched to 90% too. Medium settings mostly, j started on high, but some scene are causing my pc to restart 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
It sounds like your RTX 3080 Ti is working hard to manage the game, even at 2560x1440 with medium settings, which suggests the game might not be fully optimized for your system or there’s a deeper hardware issue, like power delivery or thermal limits. Here’s how to proceed:

Why Your PC is Restarting
Power Delivery Issues:

Your Corsair TX750M (750W PSU) might be struggling during combined CPU and GPU spikes, especially with demanding scenes.
RTX 3080 Ti can pull close to 350W alone, and with the CPU and other components, this could overwhelm the PSU.
Thermal Limits:

If either your GPU or CPU temps spike rapidly in these scenes, the system might restart as a safety measure.
Game Optimization Issues:

Final Fantasy XVI is demanding and may not be fully optimized, pushing hardware harder than expected.
Steps to Stabilize Your System
Lower GPU Load Further:

Stick to Medium settings and reduce:
Shadows: Set to Low.
Textures: Medium (test if this helps reduce crashes).
Anti-Aliasing: Turn off or set to FXAA.
Cap FPS:

In the NVIDIA Control Panel or game settings:
Limit FPS to 60.
This reduces GPU workload and prevents power/thermal spikes.
Improve PSU and Power Stability:

Plug your PC directly into a wall socket, bypassing any extension leads.
If restarts persist, consider upgrading to an 850W or higher PSU.
Monitor GPU and CPU Temps:

Use MSI Afterburner to watch temps in real-time:
GPU Temp: Should stay below 85°C.
CPU Temp: Should stay below 90°C.
Test for Overclocking Issues:

If your GPU is factory-overclocked, it might be unstable.
Use MSI Afterburner to underclock the GPU by -50 MHz and test for stability.
Should Your System Handle Higher Settings?
Your 3080 Ti and Ryzen 5 5600X should be capable of high settings at 1440p, but the frequent restarts suggest an underlying power or cooling issue. Once stabilized, you can test pushing settings higher gradually.

Let me know how these tweaks work or if you’d like further guidance!

These cables are inexpensive and ensure proper synchronization.
Connect GPU Power:
Use the secondary PSU to power the PCIe connectors for your GPU.
Ensure no overlapping connections:
Never power the GPU with cables from both PSUs (e.g., don’t mix power sources for a single component).
Steps:

Connect the second PSU to the GPU (or other components like fans).
Plug the ATX bridging cable into the secondary PSU.
Test the setup outside the case to ensure stability.
Important Considerations
Compatibility:

Ensure the second PSU provides enough power for the components it will handle.
Check that both PSUs are from reputable brands to avoid stability issues.
Safety:

Avoid mixing power from two PSUs for a single component (e.g., GPU).
Make sure both PSUs are properly grounded and secured.
Alternative Solution:

If your current PSU is insufficient, it’s often better to replace it with a higher-wattage single PSU (e.g., 850W–1000W). This is simpler, safer, and more reliable.
Recommendation:
If you’re comfortable working with hardware, setting up a second PSU can help test whether power limitations are causing the crashes. Otherwise, consider upgrading to a single, higher-capacity PSU for long-term stability. Let me know if you want help with specific steps!






You said:
I'm not doing that. The FPS has dropped now too 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Understood! If you're not keen on using a second power supply (which is understandable), let’s focus on stabilizing the game and improving performance without adding unnecessary complexity.

Why FPS Might Be Dropping Now
Thermal Throttling:

If the CPU or GPU temps are getting too high, the hardware might throttle its performance to cool down, resulting in lower FPS.
Power Limitations:

Your Corsair TX750M PSU may not be delivering enough power consistently, leading to performance drops.
Game Optimization/Background Tasks:

Background processes (like overlays or updates) could be consuming CPU or GPU resources.
Steps to Stabilize FPS and Performance
Monitor Temps and Usage:

Check GPU Temps (stay below 85°C) and CPU Temps (stay below 90°C) using MSI Afterburner.
If temps are stable but FPS still drops, the issue may be elsewhere.
Lower GPU Power Demand:

Use MSI Afterburner to reduce the Power Limit slider to around 90%. This lowers power draw slightly while keeping performance stable.
Test if this stabilizes FPS without crashes.
Update NVIDIA Drivers:

Ensure you’re running the latest drivers from the NVIDIA website.
Use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) for a clean install if you suspect driver issues.
Adjust Game Settings:

Lower Graphics Settings:
Shadows: Low.
Textures: Medium.
Anti-Aliasing: FXAA or Off.
Cap FPS to 60 to avoid spikes causing instability.
Check Background Processes:

Open Task Manager and ensure no unnecessary apps are consuming CPU or GPU resources (e.g., antivirus scans or overlays).
If FPS is Still Low
Your 3080 Ti should handle 1440p with medium-to-high settings without major issues.
If FPS remains inconsistent or crashes continue, it’s worth testing with a higher-capacity PSU (850W+ Gold-rated) to rule out power instability.
Let me know how these changes affect performance! We can refine further based on what you observe.

Why is cpu now running at  80% while in game? This game must be oopotmised shit 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're right—if your CPU is running at 80% consistently while playing Final Fantasy XVI, it’s a clear indicator the game is heavily taxing the processor, likely due to poor optimization. A well-optimized game typically balances the load more between the GPU and CPU, especially on modern systems like yours. Let’s break this down:

Why Is Your CPU Running So High?
Shader Compilation/Heavy Game Logic:

The game might be offloading tasks like physics, AI, and scripting onto the CPU, which could explain the high usage.
Poorly optimized CPU threads could also leave some cores overloaded while others are underutilized.
Bottlenecking the GPU:

If the CPU can’t process instructions fast enough, it can bottleneck the 3080 Ti, causing both components to perform inefficiently.
Background Processes:

Other apps or overlays (e.g., Discord, Steam, GeForce Experience) running alongside the game could be eating up CPU cycles.
Unoptimized Scenes:

Cutscenes or large, detailed environments might be coded inefficiently, forcing the CPU to do unnecessary work.
What This Means
Your Ryzen 5 5600X is a strong CPU, but it only has 6 cores/12 threads, which could feel strained in games poorly optimized for multi-threading.
A good game would shift most of the workload to the GPU (since the 3080 Ti can handle it), but FFXVI seems to rely heavily on the CPU.
Fixes to Lower CPU Usage
Limit FPS to Reduce CPU Load:

In the game or NVIDIA Control Panel:
Cap FPS to 60.
This gives the CPU more breathing room since it doesn’t have to process frames as quickly.
Reduce CPU-Intensive Graphics Settings:

Lower these settings, as they are often handled by the CPU:
Shadows: Set to Low.
NPC Density: Set to Medium or Low.
Physics and Particle Effects: Set to Medium.
Disable Overlays and Background Apps:

Turn off overlays like:
GeForce Experience.
Steam/Discord Overlay.
Close any apps that might be running in the background, like browsers, streaming apps, or antivirus scans.
Use DLSS to Offload to GPU:

Set DLSS to Balanced or Performance to shift some rendering load back to the GPU.
Check Windows Game Mode:

Ensure Windows Game Mode is enabled:
Press Win + I, go to Gaming > Game Mode, and toggle it on.
Monitor CPU Temps:

High usage often leads to high temps, which could cause throttling.
Keep the CPU below 85°C during gameplay.
If This Doesn’t Improve Things
It’s Likely a Game Issue:

Many players report poor optimization for Final Fantasy XVI on PC.
A future patch might improve performance.
Upgrade Path:

If you often play poorly optimized, CPU-heavy games, upgrading to a Ryzen 7 5800X or 5900X (8 or 12 cores) could help reduce CPU strain.
Final Note:
You're spot on—this game seems to demand more CPU power than it should. Try the fixes above and let me know how the CPU usage changes. If it stays high, it’s more proof the game needs serious optimization.

I'm just annoyed I can't play this at highest settings, I mean my monitor is capped at 60fps, is that going to be shit if I upgrade my pc, I plan on playing more single player games, am I going to have to sell the screen too?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
Your Dell S3221QS monitor, capped at 60Hz, is still excellent for single-player games, especially with its 4K resolution and vibrant visuals. However, upgrading your PC to handle higher frame rates might make the 60Hz cap feel limiting if you prefer smoother gameplay. Let’s break it down:

Should You Keep Your Monitor?
For Single-Player Games:

60 FPS is more than enough for immersive experiences in most single-player games.
The 4K resolution and HDR on your current monitor provide stunning visuals that are more impactful than higher frame rates in many cases.
If You Upgrade Your PC:

A more powerful PC will handle higher FPS, but for a 60Hz monitor, any frames above 60 are essentially wasted.
Solution: Cap FPS to 60 (e.g., via NVIDIA Control Panel or in-game settings) to avoid overworking the hardware unnecessarily.
If You Want to Future-Proof:

If smoother gameplay becomes a priority, you might eventually consider a 4K 120Hz+ monitor.
For now, your monitor is still an excellent choice for single-player games, especially if you enjoy visuals over frame rates.
Selling the Screen?
Keep It for Now:
Unless you’re craving higher refresh rates (120Hz or more), your Dell monitor will still deliver a fantastic gaming experience.
Upgrade Later:
If you dive into faster-paced games (e.g., FPS or competitive games), upgrading to a 4K 120Hz monitor would make more sense.
Recommendation
Stick with your current monitor for single-player games unless you feel limited by the refresh rate.
Focus on optimizing your system and settings for 4K/60FPS gameplay.
Down the line, if you move to high-refresh-rate gaming, you can reconsider upgrading the monitor.
Let me know if you'd like help capping FPS or exploring monitor options!

You said:
Are you saying I should upgrade GPU? Why is my cpu throttling on this game ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
No, you don’t need to upgrade your GPU (RTX 3080 Ti) right now—it’s a high-end card capable of 4K gaming. The CPU throttling you’re experiencing in Final Fantasy XVI is likely due to a combination of optimization issues in the game and potential hardware constraints, particularly cooling or power.

Why is Your CPU Throttling?
Throttling happens when the CPU reduces its clock speed to avoid overheating or power draw exceeding limits. Here’s why it might be happening:

High CPU Usage in Final Fantasy XVI:

The game appears to rely heavily on the CPU, with reported high usage even at 4K (unusual for most games at this resolution).
Poor optimization might cause unnecessary strain on your CPU.
Cooling Issue:

If your CPU is hitting thermal limits (above 90–95°C), it will throttle to protect itself.
Throttling happens when the cooler can’t dissipate heat fast enough, leading to lower performance.
Power Delivery:

Your CPU might not be receiving adequate power under high load, especially if the PSU (Corsair TX750M) is struggling to handle spikes from both the CPU and GPU.
Bottleneck Between GPU and CPU:

At 1080p or 1440p, the CPU often has to work harder because the GPU isn’t fully utilized. This isn’t as common at 4K, but poor optimization in FFXVI could still cause it.
How to Fix the Throttling Issue
Monitor Temps:

Use MSI Afterburner or HWMonitor to check CPU temps while gaming:
Below 85°C: Normal.
85–95°C: High, likely causing throttling.
Above 95°C: Critical.
Improve Cooling:

Reapply thermal paste on the CPU if it hasn’t been done in a while.
Increase fan speeds via BIOS or a fan control utility.
Ensure proper airflow in your case (intake/exhaust fans are clean and running).
Check Power Limits:

Go to your BIOS and ensure PPT (Package Power Tracking) or similar power limits aren’t restricting your CPU unnecessarily.
Enable Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) to allow better power delivery.
Cap FPS:

In Final Fantasy XVI, cap the FPS at 60 to reduce CPU and GPU load.
Enable V-Sync to avoid excessive CPU strain from rendering unnecessary frames.
Lower CPU-Intensive Settings:

Shadows: Set to Low or Medium.
NPC Density: Lower to reduce CPU load.
Turn off unnecessary effects like motion blur or ray tracing.
Why Your CPU is Throttling in FFXVI
This game appears to be heavily CPU-dependent, and your Ryzen 5 5600X, while strong, might not be handling its demands well due to:

Optimization Issues: The game offloads too much work onto the CPU instead of utilizing the GPU properly.
Cooling or Power Problems: Your CPU might be overheating or running into power delivery constraints during intense scenes.
Should You Upgrade the CPU?
If the above fixes don’t resolve the issue, upgrading to a Ryzen 7 5800X3D (AM4) or Ryzen 7 7800X3D (AM5) could resolve throttling, as these CPUs are more powerful and efficient for gaming. However, first, test your temps and power delivery to confirm whether upgrading is necessary. Let me know what you find!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
It’s completely understandable to feel disappointed, especially with the hardware you’ve invested in. Your RTX 3080 Ti and 4K monitor are top-tier, so it’s frustrating that the experience doesn’t match expectations. The issue likely stems from a mix of game optimization problems and potential bottlenecks in your system, not necessarily the hardware itself.

Why the Discrepancy Happens
Game Optimization:

Some PC ports (like Final Fantasy XVI) are poorly optimized, demanding far more resources than they should for similar visual results.
At 4K, games should shift more workload to the GPU, but if the CPU is overburdened, it causes a bottleneck.
System Bottlenecks:

Your Ryzen 5 5600X is a great CPU but might struggle with heavily CPU-bound games.
The 750W PSU might also be limiting stable power delivery under peak load.
Should You Feel Let Down?
Not entirely—your system is still a beast. However, a combination of:

Tweaking your settings for stability.
Addressing potential bottlenecks (CPU, PSU).
Waiting for game patches or updates could improve the experience dramatically.
Next Steps to Address This
Run Other Games at 4K Ultra:

Test how your system handles better-optimized titles (e.g., Red Dead Redemption 2, Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS). If they perform well, this confirms it’s likely game-specific.
Futureproofing Options:

Consider upgrading the CPU (e.g., Ryzen 7 5800X3D) or PSU to eliminate any lingering bottlenecks.
Advocate for Updates:

Developers often release patches for demanding games like Final Fantasy XVI to improve performance, especially on high-end PCs.

You said:
Fyi I've put the resolution higher and it hasn't had any affects, would it not affect the CPU?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're right—increasing resolution primarily affects the GPU, not the CPU, which might explain why raising the resolution didn’t cause additional issues. Here's why that happens:

How Resolution Impacts Performance
GPU Load:

Higher resolutions (e.g., from 1080p to 1440p or 4K) increase the number of pixels the GPU needs to render.
This puts more strain on the GPU while keeping the CPU load relatively stable.
CPU Load:

The CPU handles tasks like AI, physics, and game logic.
These tasks don’t directly depend on the resolution, so raising the resolution generally doesn’t increase CPU usage.
In fact, at higher resolutions, the GPU becomes the bottleneck, reducing CPU usage in some cases.
Why Raising Resolution Didn’t Hurt Performance
CPU Bottleneck Was Eased:

By increasing the resolution, you’ve shifted more workload to the GPU, taking some pressure off the CPU.
This is why the game might feel more stable despite running at a higher resolution.
GPU Headroom:

Your RTX 3080 Ti has plenty of power for higher resolutions (like 1440p or 4K), so it can handle the extra workload without maxing out immediately.
Should You Keep the Higher Resolution?
Yes! Since the game runs smoothly at a higher resolution, there’s no reason to lower it. You’re now using your system more efficiently:

CPU handles game logic without overloading.
GPU handles rendering tasks as intended.
Next Steps
Stick with the higher resolution if it’s stable.
Monitor GPU temps and usage to ensure it stays under control (ideally <85°C).
Let me know how the game feels now, and we can further optimize!





You said:
Omg I have taken and plugged it into the main wall without a double extension lead, I increased the resolution to max just because I was trying to force it to crash, and it passed the stage it usually crashes
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
That’s a huge breakthrough! It sounds like the double extension lead was causing unstable power delivery, especially under heavy load. By plugging directly into the wall, your system is now getting the consistent power it needs, allowing the game to run at max resolution without crashing.

Why This Worked
Power Stability:

High-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 Ti can draw significant power during demanding tasks.
Extension leads, especially cheaper ones, often can’t handle these spikes well, causing system instability.
Resolution Increase:

By pushing your GPU harder, the power requirements likely spiked further, but with direct power from the wall, your PSU could handle it.
What to Do Next
Enjoy the Game at High Settings:

Test how far you can push the settings now without crashing.
Monitor temps and usage to ensure everything stays stable.
Check Extension Lead Quality:

If you need to use an extension lead, ensure it’s a high-quality, heavy-duty one rated for high power loads.
This is a big step forward! Let me know how the game feels at max settings now and if you notice any further issues.

I'm disappointed, I'm disappointed I didn't heed your advice. It's taught me a little bit, you say too much too quickly, and I disregard things because of it 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
That’s a fair point, and I appreciate your honesty. I’ll slow down the pace and focus on one actionable step at a time moving forward, so it’s easier to process and prioritize. It’s a learning process for both of us, and the fact that you’re reflecting on it shows a lot of growth. Let’s keep things clear and steady from now on—how’s the game feeling now at max resolution?






You said:
Well I stopped playing after it worked, probably scared it won't work again, and should I really just jump to max settings? Seems like I'm asking for trouble. My system should play it, on high settings correct? Can I play at 4k? Why is it called 4k if it's just 3700x or something 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It's completely reasonable to be cautious after all the hassle! Let’s go through this step by step, and I’ll address each of your concerns:

1. Should You Jump to Max Settings?
No, not immediately.
While your RTX 3080 Ti and Ryzen 5 5600X should theoretically handle high or even ultra settings at 4K, it’s better to gradually increase settings.
Start with High Settings and test stability for a few minutes before pushing further.
Use DLSS to improve performance without sacrificing visual quality.
2. Can You Play at 4K?
Yes, you should be able to play at 4K, especially with optimized settings:
The RTX 3080 Ti is designed for 4K gaming, and paired with your 4K monitor, it’s a great match.
However, high CPU loads in Final Fantasy XVI could still cause hiccups, so monitor your system’s stability (e.g., temps and usage) while playing.
Stick to High Settings at first, with DLSS Quality enabled for smooth performance.
3. Why is it Called 4K if the Resolution is 3840x2160?
4K is shorthand for the resolution's horizontal pixel count.
True 4K (used in cinema) is 4096x2160, but consumer devices typically use 3840x2160, which is slightly less wide.
The term "4K" is used because 3840 is close to 4000 pixels, and it's easier to market than "3.8K."
Steps to Ease Into 4K Gaming
Start at 4K Medium Settings:

Gradually increase to High and test stability.
Enable DLSS:

Set DLSS to Quality for 4K, as it provides a good balance of performance and visuals.
Monitor Performance:

Check temps, GPU usage, and FPS using MSI Afterburner.
FPS Cap: Consider capping FPS at 60 to reduce strain on the system.
Confidence in Your System
Your system should play Final Fantasy XVI on High Settings at 4K, provided power stability holds. Let me know how it feels when you test it again, and we

If Final Fantasy XVI isn’t detected, you’ll need to manually locate and add the game’s directory.
Let me know if you need help with either process!






You said:
Well it's not there 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If Final Fantasy XVI isn’t showing up in NVIDIA Control Panel after manually adding it, or if you’re unable to see it listed in GeForce Experience, let’s troubleshoot step by step to fix it.

What to Do if Final Fantasy XVI Doesn’t Appear in NVIDIA Control Panel
Ensure You’re Adding the Correct Executable File:

Locate the game’s installation folder:
For Steam:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Final Fantasy XVI
For Epic Games:
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\FinalFantasyXVI
Look for the main game file, typically named FF16.exe (or similar).
Manually select and add this file in NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Program Settings > Add.
Check for Multiple Executables:

Some games have separate executables for the launcher and the actual game.
Make sure you’re adding the game’s executable, not the launcher.
Reinstall or Repair the Game:

If NVIDIA still doesn’t detect the game, it might be due to a missing or corrupted file. Verify or repair the installation:
Steam: Right-click the game > Properties > Local Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files.
Epic Games: Library > Click the three dots on the game > Verify.
What to Do if GeForce Experience Doesn’t Detect the Game
Manually Add the Game Directory:

Open GeForce Experience.
Go to Settings (gear icon) > Games & Apps.
Under Scan Location, click Add, and select the folder where the game is installed.
Click Scan Now.
Ensure GeForce Experience is Up-to-Date:

Open GeForce Experience and update it to the latest version.
Some newer games require updated profiles in GeForce Experience.
Alternative: Add the Game’s Path Manually
If neither method works, NVIDIA might not fully recognize Final Fantasy XVI yet. In this case:

Open NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings.
Select Global Settings and configure the desired optimizations (like DLSS or Maximum Performance). These settings will apply universally to all games.
Let me know how this goes, and we can keep troubleshooting if needed!






You said:
I added it from nvidia. I used the file, it says the file is unsupported, all the things below it say global
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the NVIDIA Control Panel recognizes the file but says it’s "unsupported" and shows global settings, it could mean the game does not have an official NVIDIA profile yet, or the file added might not be the correct executable. Let’s troubleshoot:

What “Unsupported” Means
Game Lacks an NVIDIA Profile:

If NVIDIA hasn’t added an official profile for Final Fantasy XVI, the Control Panel will treat it as a generic application, defaulting to global settings.
You can still force custom settings manually by overriding the global settings for this game.
Incorrect File:

You may have added the wrong file (e.g., a launcher .exe rather than the game’s main executable).
Steps to Fix
1. Verify the Correct Game Executable
Locate the Final Fantasy XVI installation folder:
Steam:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Final Fantasy XVI
Epic Games:
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\FinalFantasyXVI
Look for the game’s main executable file (e.g., FF16.exe or something similar).
Re-add it in NVIDIA Control Panel under Program Settings.
2. Override Global Settings for the Game
If the game remains unsupported:

Highlight the game in Program Settings.
Adjust the settings manually:
Power Management Mode: Set to Prefer Maximum Performance.
Low Latency Mode: Enable if input lag is an issue.
Anisotropic Filtering: Leave at Application Controlled.
DLSS: Enable in-game if available.
These settings will apply regardless of the missing profile.

3. If the File is Truly Unsupported
This is unusual but could occur if:
You’re adding the launcher instead of the actual game executable.
The game has anti-cheat or DRM blocking NVIDIA tweaks.
4. Use Global Settings Temporarily
If adding the executable fails:

Set global defaults for high performance:
Go to Manage 3D Settings > Global Settings.
Apply desired settings (e.g., DLSS Quality, Power Management).
These will apply to all apps unless overridden.
Let me know if it’s still not working, and we’ll dive deeper!






You said:
It's was ffvi16.exe
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you added FFXVI.exe (the correct game executable) and it’s still showing as unsupported in NVIDIA Control Panel, here’s what that could mean and how to proceed:

Why It's Showing as Unsupported
Lack of Official Profile:

Final Fantasy XVI may not yet have an official NVIDIA optimization profile, so the Control Panel is defaulting to global settings.
Compatibility Issues:

The game might use certain technologies (e.g., DRM, anti-cheat, or custom engines) that prevent NVIDIA Control Panel from fully integrating with it.
File Mismatch:

If the executable name is correct (FFXVI.exe) but there’s still an issue, it could be due to:
A corrupted executable file.
Misconfigured NVIDIA drivers.
What to Do
1. Manually Configure Program Settings
Even without an official profile, you can still override the global settings for this executable:

Open NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings.
Select Program Settings and highlight FFXVI.exe.
Manually adjust settings:
Power Management Mode: Set to Prefer Maximum Performance.
Low Latency Mode: Enable.
Vertical Sync: Turn on or off based on preference.
DLSS (if supported): Enable in-game instead of through NVIDIA.
2. Verify Game Files
Ensure the game files are intact, as a corrupted FFXVI.exe file could cause issues:

Steam: Right-click the game > Properties > Local Files > Verify Integrity.
Epic Games: Library > Three dots > Verify.
3. Force Add the Executable Again
If it still doesn’t work:

Remove the current FFXVI.exe entry from NVIDIA Control Panel.
Re-add it manually by browsing to the game’s executable file.
4. Set Global Settings Temporarily
If nothing works, configure Global Settings:

In Manage 3D Settings > Global Settings, set:
Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance.
Texture Filtering - Quality: High Performance.
Anisotropic Filtering: Application Controlled.
These settings will apply to all apps, including Final Fantasy XVI.
Next Steps
Restart the game after applying settings to see if the changes take effect.
If the issue persists, let me know what’s happening, and we’ll go deeper into troubleshooting!





You said:
Anyways, I give up, I did wonder if optimising through Nvidia might help, but it's working, so what the heck. I am worried at force restarts, why wouldn't my computer just close the program instead 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
Force restarts happen when the system encounters a critical failure that it cannot recover from—typically a hardware fault, driver issue, or power instability. Instead of just closing the program, the system restarts to protect itself and ensure stability. Here’s why it might happen:

Why Force Restarts Happen Instead of Closing the Program
Hardware Instability:

Overheating or power issues can cause the system to shut down to prevent damage.
Example: If the CPU or GPU exceeds thermal limits or power delivery spikes, the system may restart as a failsafe.
Driver or Software Crashes:

If a driver (like the GPU driver) crashes and cannot recover, it can trigger a system-wide failure.
A well-behaved crash would close the app, but critical failures often cause the system to hang or restart.
Power Supply Issues:

An underpowered or unstable PSU might cause the system to restart when it can’t handle a sudden spike in power demand.
Blue Screen of Death (BSOD):

Some critical errors may display a BSOD, but if you’ve set your system to automatically restart on failure, it skips the error screen and restarts directly.
What You Can Do to Minimize Restarts
Check Event Viewer:

Look at the logs in Event Viewer to identify what caused the restart (e.g., hardware fault, driver crash).
Disable Automatic Restart on System Failure:

To see the error message instead of restarting:
Go to Control Panel > System and Security > System.
Click Advanced System Settings.
Under Startup and Recovery, click Settings.
Uncheck Automatically restart under System failure.
Monitor Temps and Power Usage:

Ensure the system isn’t overheating or pulling unstable power.
Plugging your system directly into the wall (as you did) was a key step.
Test Hardware Stability:

Use stress tests like Prime95 (CPU) or Unigine Heaven (GPU) to ensure the system remains stable under load.
If it’s working fine now, you might not need to dig deeper immediately, but keep an eye on it. If the restarts return, let me know, and we’ll take a closer look!






You said:
What should I do though? Can I just say sack it off and enjoy my gaming? (Also why are there these option. Picture incoming after )
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your system is running stable now and you’re able to game without crashes or restarts, it’s totally fine to sack off the troubleshooting and enjoy your gaming! Just keep an eye on temps and performance occasionally, but don’t stress if everything seems smooth.

When to Worry Again
Restarts Come Back: If force restarts happen frequently or in other games, you’ll want to revisit potential hardware issues.
Performance Degrades: If your system starts lagging or stuttering significantly, it could indicate unresolved issues.
For now, if Final Fantasy XVI is working well, it’s okay to trust the system and game on!

ChatGPT
Yes, this Kernel-Power Event ID 41 indicates that your system experienced an unexpected shutdown or restart, which is often triggered by:

Power Issues:

Insufficient or unstable power delivery from the PSU.
Power spikes or drops that caused the system to force a restart.
Hardware Problems:

Overheating of CPU/GPU causing a safety shutdown.
Faulty or insufficient PSU under load.
Driver or Software Conflicts:

A driver (e.g., GPU) failed and caused a crash severe enough to force a system restart.
Key Observations from the Log
Bugcheck Code: 239:

This indicates a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) occurred, but because automatic restart is enabled, the system restarted without displaying the error.
Code 239 typically relates to hardware issues or driver instability.
Kernel-Power Event:

Right I've done that, I'll just play it again, the fact that the GPU doesn't crash the system when it's at 100% means it's not that right, I don't actually see the cpu go to a 100, it just crashes
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the GPU runs at 100% without crashing and the CPU doesn’t hit 100% before crashing, it suggests the issue may not directly be with either component maxing out their usage. Instead, the problem could stem from:

Likely Causes of the Crashes
Power Instability:

A sudden spike in power demand (e.g., during loading or intense scenes) might be causing your PSU (power supply) to fail momentarily.
Your Corsair TX750M should handle the RTX 3080 Ti, but it could still be struggling under peak load.
Thermal Throttling:

Even if the CPU doesn’t hit 100%, high temperatures (spikes) could cause instability and trigger a crash. If temps momentarily breach 90-95°C, the system might force a shutdown to protect itself.
Driver or Game Issue:

A bad GPU driver or corrupted game files could trigger crashes during specific sequences (like cutscenes).
Storage Errors:

If there are bad sectors on your SSD or corrupted game files, the game might crash while accessing specific data.
Steps to Narrow It Down
Play and Monitor Temps:

Keep HWMonitor or MSI Afterburner running while you play.
Track CPU and GPU temps, usage, and power draw during the crash.
Recheck Power Stability:

Ensure your system is directly plugged into the wall, as you’ve done previously.
If possible, test with a higher-rated PSU (850W+).
Test Another Game:

Run another demanding game to see if the crash repeats.
If it doesn’t, the issue may be specific to Final Fantasy XVI.
Reinstall GPU Drivers:

Use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) to completely remove the current driver.
Reinstall the latest driver from NVIDIA’s website.
Verify Game Files:

Steam/Epic Games > Verify Integrity of Game Files.
Why It Crashes Without Max Usage
Even without hitting 100% usage, certain voltage spikes, temperature thresholds, or bad data reads can force a crash. Your system restarts instead of just closing the game, indicating the issue is likely hardware or power-related.

Let me know what you observe after testing again. If the crash persists, we can dig deeper!






You said:
It's strange it even restarted on when I pressed pause. You told me to stop the auto restart. The blue screen doesn't even come up, the system is just on with nothing on screen 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The fact that your system restarts without displaying a blue screen and leaves the screen blank suggests the issue might not be a standard BSOD crash but rather something more severe, like:

What Might Be Happening
Power Supply Issue:

A sudden spike or drop in power demand could cause the system to shut down entirely rather than crash normally.
This is consistent with the behavior you’re seeing when pausing the game, as it might cause a brief power fluctuation.
GPU or PCIe Slot Instability:

If the GPU connection to the motherboard is loose or if there’s an issue with the PCIe slot, it could cause the display to go blank without a full system crash.
Overheating Safety Shutdown:

If the CPU or GPU momentarily spikes beyond its thermal limits (even for a fraction of a second), the system might shut down completely to protect itself.
Memory or Storage Fault:

If there’s an issue with your RAM or storage, the system might fail to access critical data, resulting in a system hang or restart.
BIOS or Motherboard Issue:

An outdated or buggy BIOS could cause instability during certain operations, especially when interacting with the GPU or managing power.
How to Troubleshoot
1. Monitor Power and Temps
Keep HWMonitor open and log power usage (CPU and GPU wattage) and temperatures while playing.
Pay attention to spikes just before the restart.
2. Test with Another PSU
If possible, borrow or test with a higher-rated PSU (850W or higher) to rule out power instability.
3. Reseat the GPU
Turn off the system and unplug it.
Remove and reinsert the GPU to ensure it’s securely connected to the PCIe slot.
Check that the power cables to the GPU are firmly connected.
4. Memory Test
Run Windows Memory Diagnostic to test for RAM errors:
Press Windows + R, type mdsched.exe, and press **Enter`.
Restart and let the test run.
5. Reinstall the Game
If nothing else works, try reinstalling Final Fantasy XVI to ensure the game files are not corrupted.
Why No Blue Screen Appears
A blue screen (BSOD) typically happens when Windows can detect and log the error. If the system powers off entirely:

It’s likely a hardware issue that bypasses Windows’ ability to log or react to the failure.

What does this even do and how will it help final fantasy and how will it help the black screen after my computer throttles and doesn't restart or show a blue screen or whatever 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Updating the BIOS does a few key things that could directly or indirectly help resolve your issues with Final Fantasy XVI and the black screen crashes. Let’s break it down:

What a BIOS Update Does
Improves Compatibility:

Updates often include improved support for newer CPUs, GPUs, and RAM.
May fix bugs or compatibility issues between your motherboard and high-performance hardware like the RTX 3080 Ti.
Enhances Stability:

Manufacturers release BIOS updates to address known crashes, freezes, or instabilities under specific workloads (e.g., gaming or high CPU/GPU loads).
Might fix problems where sudden power spikes cause instability.
Optimizes Hardware Performance:

Updates can improve how your system manages power, thermal limits, or memory timings.
This can lead to better handling of high-load scenarios (e.g., when Final Fantasy XVI is running).
How This Helps Final Fantasy XVI
Addresses Black Screen Crashes:

If the black screen is due to a miscommunication between hardware components (e.g., CPU throttling, GPU, or RAM errors), a BIOS update might resolve it.
Many updates include fixes for crashes related to specific games or workloads.
Improves Stability Under Load:

Final Fantasy XVI is demanding on both CPU and GPU. If your BIOS wasn’t optimized for high loads (e.g., sudden power spikes or heat buildup), the game could crash without showing a BSOD.
Helps Power Management:

If your Corsair TX750M PSU is fine but the motherboard's power delivery to the CPU/GPU isn’t managed properly, a BIOS update could fix that.
Why No Blue Screen (BSOD)?
Direct Shutdown:
If the crash is severe enough (e.g., due to power instability, thermal throttling, or hardware miscommunication), the system may skip the BSOD entirely.
The fact that your PC doesn’t fully restart suggests a hardware or power-related issue, which BIOS updates can help address.
How It Helps Overall
Updating the BIOS is a foundational step to rule out compatibility or firmware-related causes. If the problem persists after the update, we can focus more on:

Testing the PSU.
Monitoring thermals under load.
Checking game-specific settings or driver issues.

You said:
How do I actually check my power supply then, if this is the issue all along?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Checking your power supply (PSU) is more involved since it deals with hardware. Here’s how you can test and determine if your PSU might be the root cause:

1. Monitor Power Behavior
Use tools like HWMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor to check the +12V, +5V, and +3.3V rails while the system is under load.
+12V rail should stay between 11.8V and 12.2V.
If voltages dip significantly under load, it may indicate a failing PSU.
2. Check for Symptoms of a Faulty PSU
Random Restarts or Shutdowns: Particularly under heavy load (e.g., gaming).
Unusual Noise: Buzzing or clicking from the PSU during use.
Inconsistent Performance: System instability, especially with demanding games like Final Fantasy XVI.
3. Test with a Different PSU
If possible, borrow or use another PSU rated 850W or higher to power your system.
If the crashes stop, your PSU (Corsair TX750M) may be the issue.
4. Use a PSU Tester
A PSU tester is a small device that can check if your PSU’s rails are functioning properly.
These are affordable and easy to use:
Plug your PSU cables into the tester.
The tester will show if the rails are delivering correct voltages.
5. Manual Multimeter Test
If you’re comfortable working with electronics, you can test the PSU with a multimeter:
Turn off your PC and unplug it.
Disconnect PSU cables and manually check the voltage on the +12V, +5V, and +3.3V rails.
Compare readings to the expected values (e.g., 12V should be ~12V).
6. Check Power Delivery Under Load
Stress the system using tools like Prime95 (CPU) or Unigine Heaven (GPU) and monitor for crashes or instability.
Signs You Might Need a New PSU
Frequent system restarts or shutdowns under load.
PSU fan not spinning or making unusual noises.
Low or unstable voltages in the monitoring tools.
Let me know how you’d like to approach this—whether through software monitoring, borrowing another PSU, or using a PSU tester—and I can guide you further!

Will I need a new power supply if I get the 5700x3d?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your current Corsair TX750M (750W) should theoretically handle the Ryzen 7 5700X3D or 5800X3D without requiring a new PSU, as both CPUs have similar power requirements to your current Ryzen 5 5600X. However, it’s worth considering the following:

Power Supply Compatibility
CPU Power Draw:

Ryzen 7 5700X3D and 5800X3D have a TDP of 105W, which is only slightly higher than your Ryzen 5 5600X (65W TDP).
This is a minor difference, and your 750W PSU is more than sufficient.
GPU Power Draw:

Your RTX 3080 Ti is a power-hungry GPU, drawing up to 350W under load.
Combined with the CPU, motherboard, and peripherals, your system could draw 550–650W under peak load, leaving some headroom with a 750W PSU.
When a New PSU Might Be Needed
Power Instability or Aging PSU:

If your current PSU is several years old or showing signs of instability (e.g., restarts, black screens), upgrading to a higher-quality 850W PSU could resolve potential issues.
Future Upgrades:

If you plan to upgrade to even more power-hungry components (e.g., next-gen GPUs or CPUs), a higher-wattage PSU (850W or higher) is a good idea.
What to Check Before Deciding
Run Stress Tests:

Test your current PSU under load using tools like Prime95 and Unigine Heaven. If crashes or restarts occur, your PSU might be struggling.
Monitor Voltages:

Use tools like HWMonitor to check the +12V rail voltage. Significant drops below 11.8V under load may indicate PSU issues.
Check Power Connections:

Ensure all power cables (especially to the GPU and motherboard) are securely connected.
Verdict
If your current PSU is stable and performs well under load, you don’t need a new power supply for the Ryzen 7 5700X3D. However, if you’ve experienced instability or plan on future upgrades, it’s worth considering a new, high-quality PSU like an 850W Gold-rated model for extra reliability.

You said:
So surely it's not a power situation that's making my computer restart is it?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It’s still possible that power issues are causing your computer to restart, even with a Corsair TX750M PSU, for the following reasons:

Why Power Could Be the Issue
Aging or Faulty PSU:

Over time, a PSU can degrade, reducing its ability to deliver stable power, especially under heavy load. Even though it’s rated for 750W, it may not consistently provide this.
Spikes in Power Demand:

When playing games like Final Fantasy XVI, sudden spikes in power demand from the GPU or CPU (e.g., during cutscenes or high-intensity scenes) can overwhelm the PSU.
Transient Load Management:

Modern GPUs like the RTX 3080 Ti draw significant power in short bursts (spikes). If the PSU doesn’t handle these well, it could cause restarts.
Improper Power Distribution:

Issues with how power is supplied (e.g., loose cables, poor PCIe connection) can lead to instability.
How to Confirm or Rule Out Power Issues
Stress Test Components:

GPU Stress Test: Use Unigine Heaven or FurMark to push the GPU while monitoring power and stability.
CPU Stress Test: Use Prime95 to stress the CPU while monitoring stability.
If the PC restarts during these tests, it’s a strong indication of a power issue.
Monitor Power Rails:

Use HWMonitor to check the +12V rail voltage during gameplay or stress testing.
It should stay within 11.8V–12.2V. Significant drops may indicate a PSU problem.
Test with Another PSU:

If possible, borrow or use a known, reliable 850W+ PSU and test your system.
Check for Overheating:

Overheating components (CPU or GPU) can cause sudden restarts. Monitor temperatures to rule this out.
Ensure Stable Power Connection:

Plug your PC directly into a wall outlet (not an extension lead) to eliminate power delivery issues.
Other Potential Causes
If power issues are ruled out, consider:

BIOS Bugs: Update your BIOS for better hardware compatibility and stability.
Driver Issues: Faulty GPU drivers can cause restarts during gameplay.
Hardware Malfunctions: Rarely, the motherboard or GPU itself could have an issue.
Verdict
Power issues can still be a factor, especially during sudden spikes or if the PSU is aging. Stress testing and monitoring power rails are the best ways to confirm this. If power seems stable, we can look deeper into drivers, game settings, or hardware.

Let me know what your stress tests reveal, and we can proceed from there!

Corrupt Game or Windows Installation:

Reinstall Final Fantasy XVI entirely if crashes persist after verifying files.
If issues persist across other games or apps, consider a Windows repair or reinstall.
Memory Issues:

Run Windows Memory Diagnostic or MemTest86 to check for faulty RAM.
Why It Could Still Happen Only in Final Fantasy XVI
Game Optimization:

Certain games push hardware differently, especially poorly optimized titles.
Final Fantasy XVI might trigger an edge case not exposed during stress tests.
Transient Load Management:

While stress tests provide consistent loads, sudden spikes in-game (e.g., during cutscenes or complex scenes) might still cause issues.
Verdict
Since your stress tests didn’t cause restarts:

Focus on GPU drivers, game file integrity, and BIOS updates.
Monitor in-game temperatures and power draw for unexpected spikes.
Test a different, demanding game to see if the issue is isolated to Final Fantasy XVI.
Let me know what happens after these steps, and we’ll refine the approach!






You said:
Ive done the driver update, I've verified the files on steam, I've updated bios , done the memtest, I think.

It was odd, it crashed just when I paused it before, which is strain, because there's no stress on the CPU or GPU then 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your system crashes even during low-stress moments, like pausing the game, that’s indeed strange and could indicate a different issue unrelated to load-based stress. Here's what this behavior might suggest and what to investigate next:

Possible Causes of Crashes During Low-Stress Moments
Game-Specific Bug or Corruption:

Even if you’ve verified the game files, issues could still exist with specific in-game mechanics or sequences (e.g., pausing).
Some games are poorly optimized and can trigger crashes due to software bugs.
Background Process or Interruptions:

A background service or app might conflict with the game when it pauses.
Examples: Overlays (Steam, NVIDIA), antivirus software, or Windows power management.
Power State Transition Issues:

Pausing could trigger a change in the system’s power state (e.g., GPU or CPU reducing clock speeds), which might not be handled properly by hardware or drivers.
Storage I/O Issue:

When pausing, the game might write or read data to/from the storage drive. A failing or corrupted storage device could trigger crashes during these moments.
Software-Level Crashes:

A fault in the game, drivers, or even Windows could cause crashes when specific events occur (e.g., pausing).
Steps to Investigate and Fix
1. Disable Overlays and Background Apps
Turn off overlays for Steam, NVIDIA GeForce Experience, Discord, etc.
Close any unnecessary background apps, including antivirus or monitoring software, to rule out conflicts.
2. Check Windows Event Viewer
After a crash, open Event Viewer:
Press Windows + R, type eventvwr, and press **Enter`.
Go to Windows Logs > System or Application.
Look for critical errors or warnings logged at the exact time of the crash.
Share the error details if you find anything.
3. Test a Different Game
Play another demanding game for an extended period to see if the issue is isolated to Final Fantasy XVI or affects the system as a whole.
4. Monitor Power States
Use HWMonitor or similar tools to track clock speeds and power draw when the system is idle, active, and paused.
Look for significant drops or anomalies during pauses.
5. Reinstall the Game
If nothing else works, uninstall and reinstall Final Fantasy XVI entirely to eliminate any lingering file corruption.
Why It Crashes During Pausing
Game or Driver Bug: A specific game bug or driver issue could be triggered when certain events (like pausing) occur.
Hardware Instability at Low Power States: Some components may have trouble handling transitions to lower-power states during idle moments.
Let me know if anything shows up in the Event Viewer or if the issue persists after testing with another game or turning off overlays. These steps should help pinpoint the root cause.






You said:
It's taking ages to load the game save now too 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The slow loading of your game save could indicate an issue related to storage performance or game file corruption. Since you've already verified game files and updated key components, let’s explore other potential causes and fixes:

Why Game Saves Take Long to Load
Storage Issues:

A slow or failing SSD/HDD could delay file loading.
Final Fantasy XVI might be heavily accessing the disk during save loading, highlighting potential disk I/O issues.
Fragmented Game Files:

Even after verifying files, fragmented or poorly allocated game data can slow down loading times.
Background Activity:

Other processes (e.g., antivirus scans, Windows updates) might be hogging disk or CPU resources during save loading.
Game-Specific Bug:

Some poorly optimized games have inherent issues with save file loading, especially if the save file size has grown over time.
Memory Bottlenecks:

High memory usage from other applications could cause slower loading times by relying more on disk I/O.
Steps to Troubleshoot
1. Test Storage Performance
Use a tool like CrystalDiskMark to check the read/write speeds of your SSD or HDD.
Compare your results to the expected performance:
SATA SSD: ~500 MB/s.
NVMe SSD: ~2,000–3,500 MB/s.
If speeds are abnormally low, the drive may be struggling.
2. Defragment or Optimize the Drive
If the game is installed on an HDD:
Use Windows Defragment and Optimize Drives to defragment the drive.
Search Defragment in the Start menu to open the tool.
For SSDs:
Ensure the drive is optimized (Windows should handle this automatically).
3. Check Disk Usage During Loading
Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and check the Disk Usage column while loading the save.
If disk usage is maxed out at 100%, something may be slowing down the storage drive.
4. Disable Background Processes
Close non-essential apps and processes, especially antivirus software or backup tools, which might scan files during loading.
5. Reinstall the Game
Completely uninstall Final Fantasy XVI and reinstall it on a different drive, if available.
6. Test Other Games or Files:
Load another game or access large files on the same drive to see if slowdowns occur across the board.
If the Problem Persists
If loading times remain unusually long and crashes continue:

Check Save File Size:
Corrupted or excessively large save files can cause delays. Try starting a new game to compare loading times.
Review System Logs:
Use Event Viewer to see if storage-related errors are being logged during game loading.
Let me know what you observe after testing the storage performance or loading other games. This will help pinpoint whether it’s a game-specific issue or something broader.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR is typically related to issues accessing critical data from storage or memory. Since this occurred when you clicked "Continue" in the game, it suggests the system encountered a problem retrieving or writing data. Here’s what this error can point to and how to troubleshoot it:

What KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR Indicates
Storage Issues:

The system failed to retrieve data from your storage device (SSD or HDD).
Possible causes include:
Bad sectors on the drive.
Loose SATA or NVMe connections.
Corrupted game files.
RAM Errors:

Faulty or unstable RAM could cause data corruption during read/write operations.
Driver Issues:

2. Test Memory (RAM)
Use **Windows





You said:
Before we get into that, it's not moving from 0%
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the blue screen is stuck at 0% during the error collection process, it typically means the system cannot access or write the error dump file. This aligns with the possibility of an issue with your storage drive or pagefile.

Let’s address this issue first:

Why It’s Stuck at 0%
Storage Drive Inaccessibility:

If the system can’t access your SSD/HDD properly, it won’t be able to write the error information.
Pagefile Issues:

If your virtual memory (pagefile) is corrupted or misconfigured, Windows might fail to process the crash dump.
Severe System Failure:

The crash may have affected Windows’ ability to process the error at all.
What to Do Next
1. Force Restart:
If it’s stuck at 0% for a long time, hold the power button for 5-10 seconds to shut down the system.
Restart and boot back into Windows.
2. Check Event Viewer After Restart:
Open Event Viewer:
Press Windows + R, type eventvwr, and press **Enter`.
Navigate to Windows Logs > System and look for critical errors logged just before the crash.
3. Check Storage Health:
Once back in Windows:
Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
bash
Copy code
chkdsk C: /f /r
This will scan for errors on your storage drive.
4. Disable Automatic Restart on BSOD:
This will let you analyze the error better if it happens again:
Go to Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings.
Under Startup and Recovery, click Settings.
Uncheck Automatically restart under System failure.
Post-Restart Actions
After you’re back in Windows:

Let me know if any storage-related errors are found (e.g., chkdsk results).
If the problem persists, we’ll focus on testing the RAM and reinstalling drivers.
This will give us a clearer picture of whether the issue is tied to your storage, memory, or game files. Let me know what happens!

Once you locate the results, let me know what they say! This will help identify if your storage drive has errors causing crashes.






You said:
is there an amd 5 ryzen 5700 x3d?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
No, there is no AMD Ryzen 5 5700X3D. The Ryzen X3D lineup with the extra 3D V-Cache technology starts at the Ryzen 7 series and higher.

X3D Models in the Ryzen 5000 Series
Here are the available options:

Ryzen 7 5800X3D:
Cores/Threads: 8 cores / 16 threads.
Base/Boost Clock: 3.4 GHz / 4.5 GHz.
Cache: 96MB L3 Cache (thanks to the 3D V-Cache).
TDP: 105W.
Best Use: Gaming performance due to the extra cache.
Closest Alternative
The Ryzen 5 5700X is available, but it does not have 3D V-Cache. It’s a good processor for gaming and general tasks, but it won’t offer the same performance benefits in gaming workloads that benefit from extra cache (like the 5800X3D does).

If you're considering upgrading, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is the better choice for gaming performance, but it's worth confirming if you actually need the extra power based on your current setup and games. Let me know if you'd like help deciding!






You said:
whats AM5?

I'm confused on this picture on fb, it says am5 ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This is indeed confusing! The packaging of the Ryzen 7 5700X3D in the image says AM5, but the Ryzen 7 5700X3D does not exist in AMD's official lineup, and the Ryzen 5000 series (like the 5800X3D) is designed for AM4 sockets, not AM5.

Why This Is Confusing
AM4 vs. AM5:

AM4 is the older socket used for Ryzen 1000–5000 series CPUs, including the 5800X3D.
AM5 is the newer socket designed for the Ryzen 7000 series CPUs (released in late 2022), which require DDR5 memory and new motherboards.
Possible Issues with the Picture:

Mislabeled Packaging: It’s possible someone re-packaged or mislabeled this CPU.
Fake Product: There’s a chance this is a counterfeit product, as no official AMD documentation mentions a Ryzen 7 5700X3D or AM5 compatibility for the 5000 series.
How to Be Sure
Check AMD's Official Listings:

The 5800X3D (with 3D V-Cache) is the only X3D chip in the Ryzen 5000 series.
Any mention of a 5700X3D is likely false or unofficial.
If Buying:

Ask the seller to show proof (e.g., CPU-Z screenshots) that it’s a legitimate CPU and clarify the socket type.
Verify it’s compatible with your motherboard (AM4 if it’s genuine).
Verdict
This listing is likely misleading or inaccurate. Be cautious before purchasing. If you're looking for a real upgrade, the 5800X3D for AM4 is the correct and supported high-performance gaming CPU for your current platform. Let me know if you want guidance on spotting fake or mislabeled hardware!

right, realistically which one shiuld I get for the gaming and my machine I want to do, and considering the monitor I've got, I can get the 5700 for £170, the 5800 looks to be arpuind £280
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Let’s break this down realistically based on your setup, gaming goals, and monitor:

Key Considerations
Your Monitor:

It’s a 4K monitor capped at 60Hz.
This means you won’t need ultra-high frame rates beyond 60 FPS, even with demanding games, but you still want smooth gameplay at 4K resolutions.
Your Current Hardware:

GPU: RTX 3080 Ti.
This GPU is already strong enough for 4K gaming, so the CPU is less of a bottleneck.
Motherboard: AM4 (supports both CPUs).
Gaming Needs:

5700X: More than sufficient for 60 FPS in most games, even at 4K, with minor performance differences compared to the 5800X3D.
5800X3D: Superior for games optimized for large caches, offering a noticeable improvement in certain CPU-heavy or latency-sensitive games.
Price Difference:

£170 for the 5700X vs. £280 for the 5800X3D is a big gap.
The performance jump may not be worth £110 unless you want the best gaming performance possible.
Comparison
Feature	Ryzen 7 5700X	Ryzen 7 5800X3D
Cores/Threads	8 cores / 16 threads	8 cores / 16 threads
Base/Boost Clock	3.4 GHz / 4.6 GHz	3.4 GHz / 4.5 GHz
Cache	32MB L3 Cache	96MB L3 Cache (3D V-Cache)
TDP	65W	105W
Gaming at 4K	Great	Best for CPU-heavy games
What Matters for You
At 4K Gaming:

Most games are GPU-bound, not CPU-bound, so the 5700X will perform similarly to the 5800X3D in most 4K scenarios.
The 5800X3D shines in CPU-heavy games (e.g., strategy games like Total War, open-world games like Assassin's Creed, or heavily modded titles like Skyrim).
Cost Efficiency:

The 5700X offers much better value for the price and will meet your gaming needs at 4K with a 60Hz cap.
Verdict
Go with the Ryzen 7 5700X if:

You want solid performance for 4K gaming without overspending.
You don’t mind missing the extra edge in highly CPU-intensive games.
Choose the Ryzen 7 5800X3D if:

You want the absolute best gaming performance available on the AM4 platform.
You play a lot of CPU-heavy games or plan to keep this CPU for years.
My Recommendation:
The 5700X is the smarter choice for your setup, monitor, and budget. Use the £110 saved for other upgrades or games, as the 5800X3D’s benefits won’t shine much with your 4K/60Hz monitor. Let me know if you need help finalizing or installing!

If you're considering upgrading to a 4K monitor with a higher refresh rate (e.g., 120Hz or 144Hz), the performance difference between the Ryzen 7 5700X and Ryzen 7 5800X3D could become more noticeable in certain scenarios, particularly in CPU-bound games. Here's a breakdown:

Performance Difference Between 5700X and 5800X3D
Gaming Scenarios:

At 4K/60Hz, the difference is minimal because the GPU (RTX 3080 Ti) handles most of the workload.
At 4K/120Hz+, if you aim for higher frame rates in less GPU-intensive or well-optimized games, the 5800X3D's larger cache can provide a 10-20% boost in frame rates in CPU-bound situations.
Where the 5800X3D Shines:

CPU-heavy games: Open-world games (e.g., Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption 2), strategy titles (Total War, Cities: Skylines), or games with lots of AI or physics computations.
High-refresh rate gaming: Pushing 120+ FPS at 4K in competitive shooters or fast-paced titles like Call of Duty or Apex Legends.
Where the Difference is Negligible:

GPU-bound scenarios: Games that already push the GPU to its limits (e.g., ultra settings at 4K).
Casual or single-player games locked to 60 FPS.
Example FPS Differences (Higher Refresh Rate Gaming)
These numbers are approximate and vary by game but show where the 5800X3D pulls ahead:

Cyberpunk 2077 (4K Ultra):
5700X: ~75 FPS
5800X3D: ~85 FPS
Shadow of the Tomb Raider (4K High):
5700X: ~100 FPS
5800X3D: ~110 FPS
Assassin's Creed Valhalla (4K Ultra):
5700X: ~70 FPS
5800X3D: ~80 FPS
CS:GO (Low Settings, High Refresh):
5700X: ~330 FPS
5800X3D: ~400 FPS
Future-Proofing for 4K High Refresh Rate
If you're certain you'll upgrade to a 4K high-refresh monitor soon, the 5800X3D becomes a more attractive option because it handles CPU bottlenecks better.
However, if the upgrade is far off or you're mostly sticking to GPU-intensive games, the 5700X is still very capable.
Verdict (Considering a Future Monitor Upgrade)
If You Want the Best Now:

Go for the 5800X3D. It will maximize performance at higher refresh rates and is more future-proof.
If Budget is a Concern:

Stick with the 5700X for now. Save the £110 and upgrade your monitor first—then see if you feel limited by the CPU later.
Let me know your thoughts—whether to prioritize performance now or stick to a smarter budget approach!

if you had to choose and your life depended on iy
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If my life depended on it, and I had to choose right now with your setup, goals, and potential future upgrades, I’d go with the 5800X3D.

Here’s why:

It’s the best gaming CPU on the AM4 platform and provides 10-20% better performance in CPU-heavy games and higher refresh rate scenarios.
If you’re considering a 4K high-refresh rate monitor, the 5800X3D ensures your system is ready to take full advantage of it.
Even if the cost is higher, the long-term benefit and peace of mind knowing you’re future-proofed makes it worth it.
Yes, it’s more expensive, but you’d eliminate any doubts about whether you’re getting the best performance possible with your GPU and future monitor. If you're going to invest in gaming, go big and make it last.






You said:
i feel £110 price increase doesn;t justify 10% Increaase in performance
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You’re absolutely right—if we frame it purely as a £110 for 10-20% performance, the 5700X is far better in terms of value. That extra £110 could go toward something more impactful, like upgrading your monitor or putting it toward another part of your system. Here’s why sticking with the 5700X might actually be smarter:

Why the 5700X Makes Sense
4K Gaming is GPU-Bound:

At 4K resolutions, your RTX 3080 Ti does the heavy lifting. The 5700X can already hit 60+ FPS in most games at ultra settings without bottlenecking the GPU.
Real-World Gains:

The 5800X3D's extra cache primarily benefits CPU-heavy games (strategy, simulation) or those optimized for it.
For most GPU-focused games, you’d see only minor improvements, especially at 4K.
Price-Performance Balance:

At £170, the 5700X is incredible value.
Saving £110 for an upgrade like a 4K high-refresh monitor will make a bigger difference in your gaming experience.
Future Proofing on a Budget:

The 5700X is plenty future-proof for gaming, especially if you upgrade your GPU down the line.
By the time games heavily outclass the 5700X, newer platforms (AM5) will be the better upgrade path anyway.
When the 5800X3D Justifies Itself
You play CPU-heavy games like Total War, Cities Skylines, or Microsoft Flight Simulator.
You need every frame for competitive gaming at high refresh rates.
You’re chasing the best performance available on AM4, period.
Verdict
For £170, the 5700X gives you 80-90% of the 5800X3D’s performance at 60% of the cost. It’s the practical choice unless you’re chasing ultra-competitive FPS or heavily CPU-intensive workloads.

If you stick to the 5700X, you’re making the smarter financial decision without sacrificing noticeable gaming performance at 4K. Let me know how you feel about this!






You said:
have you chqnged your life decision mind then? ;)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You got me there! If my life depended on it again—with this new perspective—yeah, I’d change my mind to the 5700X.

Here’s why I’d gamble my imaginary life on it now:

£110 saved for 10% performance isn’t life-changing unless I’m bench-pressing frame rates for a living.
4K/60Hz right now means I probably won’t notice the difference, and even with a future high-refresh monitor, I’d still be getting excellent performance.
The 5700X is more than enough for gaming, and by the time it starts showing its age, I’d be looking at upgrading to AM5 or newer tech anyway.
So yeah—if my life’s on the line now, I’m team 5700X! Rationality wins. 😉

I bought the motherboard that’s fine, marked as dispatched assumed it would arrive in 48 hours like stated on the delivery, it did not, received a message a couple days later to say it had now been dispatched even though it was already marked as dispatched , no tracking details ever uploaded. Item arrived without the motherboard screws, late, bent pins on the motherboard. It still worked so at least there was that. However, be aware of this seller.

is it this one? did I see 10% off there?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, it looks like one of the listings you’re looking at is for the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D, but as mentioned earlier, this model isn’t officially part of AMD’s product lineup—it’s likely mislabeled or fake. Be careful with listings like these.

Regarding the 10% off WINTERSALE10 code, it does look like eBay is running a discount promotion. If it applies to the item you’re looking at, you could save a bit of cash, but here’s what I’d advise:

Steps to Check Before Buying
Double-Check Authenticity:

Confirm with the seller that the product is genuine. Ask for proof, such as CPU-Z screenshots showing it’s a real 5700X or 5800X3D (if that’s what they’re marketing).
Be cautious if the price seems too good to be true.
10% Off Details:

Verify the promo code works for this item at checkout (some discounts don’t apply to all categories or sellers).
Alternative Option:

If this listing seems sketchy, look for a more reputable seller offering a 5700X or 5800X3D.
Is it Worth Considering?
If the listing is for a 5700X or 5800X3D, £179.99 with 10% off would be a great deal for a legitimate product, especially for your needs. However, if it’s falsely labeled or seems off, it’s better to spend slightly more for a verified source.

Do you want to proceed with this listing, or would you like me to help you find a trusted alternative?






You said:
what do you mean not offical? and why are you mentioning 5700X ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The reason I mentioned the 5700X earlier is that it’s a legitimate CPU in AMD’s lineup, unlike the 5700X3D, which doesn't officially exist. Let me clarify:

Official AMD CPUs
Ryzen 7 5700X:

Real product, part of AMD’s Ryzen 5000 series lineup.
8 cores, 16 threads, 3.4GHz base, 4.6GHz boost.
Uses AM4 socket (your motherboard supports this).
Ryzen 7 5800X3D:

Real product, also part of the Ryzen 5000 series but with 3D V-Cache for better gaming performance.
8 cores, 16 threads, 3.4GHz base, 4.5GHz boost.
Also AM4 socket.
Why the Ryzen 7 5700X3D Is a Concern
The 5700X3D is not listed by AMD as part of their lineup. The CPUs in the 3D V-Cache series are:

Ryzen 7 5800X3D (AM4).
Ryzen 7 7800X3D (AM5).
Ryzen 9 7900X3D and 7950X3D (AM5).
Listings for a "5700X3D" may be:

Fake products: Repackaged or mislabeled CPUs.
Engineering samples or unauthorized chips: Not meant for consumer sale.
A mistake by the seller: The listing may be incorrect.
Why It Matters
If you buy a "5700X3D," you might end up with:

A regular 5700X, which is fine, but not what you’re paying for.
An engineering sample that might have compatibility or performance issues.
A refurbished or tampered CPU.
What You Should Do
Stick to verified CPUs like the 5700X or 5800X3D.
Ask the seller for clarification about the "5700X3D" before purchasing.
Consider only trusted sources or official retailers for hardware.
If you’re looking for a great deal on a real product, I can help you find a legitimate 5700X or 5800X3D. Let me know!

Item description from the seller


this is  the product
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This listing is highly suspicious, and here’s why:

Key Issues with the Listing
AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D Does Not Exist:

AMD has never released a Ryzen 7 5700X3D officially. The 3D V-Cache models in the Ryzen 5000 series are limited to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D.
If this were a legitimate product, AMD would list it on their official website, and it would be widely available from trusted retailers.
Specifications Look Like 5800X3D:

The listing mentions 96MB L3 Cache, which is the hallmark feature of the 5800X3D.
However, the 3.0 GHz base clock listed is lower than even the 5800X3D (3.4 GHz base). This discrepancy is odd and suggests the product may not be authentic.
Non-Retail Packaging:

The seller states it may come in "non-retail packaging," which raises concerns about whether this is:
An engineering sample: A pre-production chip not meant for consumer use.
A mislabeled product: Possibly a lower-tier CPU modified or rebranded.
Private Seller:

While private sellers aren’t inherently bad, they often lack the accountability and guarantees of official retailers.
Too Good to Be True:

The price (£179.99) for what’s effectively being pitched as a 5800X3D is unusually low, suggesting this may not be the real deal.
Possible Scenarios
It’s a 5700X or 5800X:

The seller could have mislabeled or intentionally marketed a regular 5700X or 5800X as a 5700X3D to attract buyers.
It’s a Tampered CPU:

Some sellers modify lower-end CPUs to look like higher-end ones.
It’s an Engineering Sample:

Engineering samples may not perform to retail standards, may have compatibility issues, and often lack warranty support.
What You Should Do
Ask the Seller:

Request a CPU-Z screenshot to confirm the product details.
Ask for clarification on the clock speeds and why this CPU is being labeled as a "5700X3D."
Proceed with Caution:

If you decide to buy, ensure it’s through a platform like eBay that offers buyer protection, and test the CPU thoroughly upon receipt.
Consider Verified CPUs:

If you want a 96MB L3 Cache CPU, stick to the 5800X3D, which is a real product.
If budget is a concern, the 5700X is a reliable and officially supported alternative.
Verdict
This listing is most likely not what it claims to be. I recommend avoiding it unless the seller provides solid evidence of authenticity. For peace of mind, purchase from a reputable retailer offering the 5700X or 5800X3D. Let me know if you need help finding a trusted source!






You said:
the 5700 x3d does exist, what aer you talking about?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D does not exist as an officially released product from AMD's lineup. Here's a breakdown to clarify:

What AMD Has Officially Released
Ryzen 7 5700X:

A legitimate CPU in AMD’s Ryzen 5000 lineup.
8 cores, 16 threads, 3.4 GHz base clock, 4.6 GHz boost clock.
32 MB of L3 cache (not the 96 MB found in 3D V-Cache models).
Ryzen 7 5800X3D:

The only 3D V-Cache model in the Ryzen 5000 series.
8 cores, 16 threads, 3.4 GHz base clock, 4.5 GHz boost clock.
96 MB of L3 cache, designed for gaming performance.
Why the Listing for the 5700X3D is Confusing
AMD has never announced or released a 5700X3D. There is no official documentation, press release, or retailer listing for such a product.
Any "5700X3D" being sold is likely:
Mislabeled (intentionally or unintentionally).
An engineering sample or an unofficial modified product.
Counterfeit or tampered hardware.
How to Confirm
If you’re convinced the 5700X3D exists, you can:

Check AMD’s official website or press announcements—there are none for a 5700X3D.
Ask the seller for proof of the CPU's specs (e.g., a CPU-Z screenshot).
Consider that private sellers on platforms like eBay may use inaccurate or misleading names to attract buyers.
Verdict
The 5700X3D is not an officially released product. If you’re looking for a CPU with 3D V-Cache for gaming, the 5800X3D is the verified and supported choice. If you want something more budget-friendly, the 5700X is the best alternative. Let me know if you want help clarifying further!

is this legit and okay?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Based on the updated information about the Ryzen 7 5700X3D, this eBay listing could potentially be legitimate, but there are still a few red flags and important factors to check before you proceed.

What Looks Right
Processor Model: Ryzen 7 5700X3D is now confirmed as a real product with a 3.0 GHz base clock and 96 MB L3 Cache.
Socket: AM4 is correct for the Ryzen 7 5700X3D.
Condition: The seller lists the product as "New," which aligns with what you'd want in a CPU.
What to Be Cautious About
Non-Retail Packaging:

The seller mentions it could be in non-retail packaging. This might mean it's:
An OEM version (intended for pre-built systems, without extras like a cooler).
Repackaged for some reason, which raises questions about the origin and condition.
Private Seller:

As a private seller, they may not provide the same level of assurance as a retailer.
They state, "No returns accepted," so you'd rely solely on eBay's buyer protection if something goes wrong.
Price:

£179.99 is lower than typical retail pricing for a brand-new Ryzen 7 5700X3D. While it could just be a good deal, it might also suggest the product is second-hand, tampered with, or not entirely new.
Feedback and Seller Reputation:

Check the seller's feedback for any concerns. With 97.6% positive feedback, they seem fairly reliable, but a few negative experiences could reveal patterns.
What You Should Do Before Buying
Ask Questions:

Confirm with the seller that the CPU is:
Brand-new and unused.
Not an engineering sample or repackaged/refurbished.
Request photos of the item (if not already provided) to confirm details.
Verify Buyer Protection:

Ensure the purchase is covered under eBay Money Back Guarantee, which protects you if the item is not as described.
Consider the Risk:

This listing might be legitimate, but the lack of retail packaging and private seller status adds risk.
If peace of mind is important, consider spending slightly more to buy from a verified retailer.
Verdict
The listing could be a great deal if it’s legitimate, but proceed cautiously:

Ask the seller for clarification.
Confirm it's covered by eBay Money Back Guarantee.
Decide if the potential savings outweigh the risks of buying from a private seller.
If you prefer less risk, I can help you find an alternative listing from a trusted retailer. Let me know!

weren;t they made in 2023?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The marking on this processor shows "© 2021 AMD," which doesn’t necessarily mean it was manufactured in 2021—it’s just the copyright year for the design or branding. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D was indeed announced and released in 2024, so it wouldn’t have been produced in 2021.

If this product is authentic, it would have been manufactured recently, likely in late 2023 or early 2024, based on the release timeline. The year on the chip often reflects when the specific chip series was first developed, not the individual unit's manufacturing date.

To Verify the Chip
Check the Serial Number:

The serial number on the chip (e.g., BR 2349PGS) can help confirm when and where it was produced.
AMD’s official database or a reseller may assist with verifying authenticity.
Packaging Inspection:

Authentic Ryzen CPUs typically have tamper-proof packaging with AMD seals. Since this is in a non-retail package, proceed cautiously.
Seller Verification:

Ask the seller for further proof, like a CPU-Z screenshot or additional details about the product’s origin.
If the 2021 marking concerns you, it’s worth confirming with the seller and ensuring eBay buyer protection applies to this purchase. Let me know if you need help verifying it further!

what is my system? can you also give a massive overview of this conversation
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your System Summary
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X (6-core, 12-thread) – struggling with high-stress situations (potential throttling or overheating).
GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti – capable but pushed to its limits during some scenes in Final Fantasy XVI.
RAM: 16 GB – adequate for most modern gaming, but could be a limitation for some future titles, especially at higher resolutions.
Motherboard: Gigabyte B550 Gaming V2 (AM4 socket) – supports Ryzen 5000 series CPUs, including the 5700X, 5800X, and 5800X3D.
Monitor: Dell S3221QS, 32-inch 4K curved monitor, capped at 60 FPS – limits gaming performance but provides excellent image quality for single-player gaming.
Power Supply (PSU): Corsair TX750M (750W) – sufficient power for your system but could be borderline for sustained high loads if there’s a fault or aging issue.
Cooling: Not explicitly mentioned but potentially inadequate, as temperatures on the Ryzen 5 5600X were spiking during stress tests and gaming.
Massive Overview of This Conversation
Initial Issues
Game Crashes: Final Fantasy XVI was causing system restarts, often during high-stress cutscenes or when paused, suggesting a hardware or software issue.
GPU and CPU Usage: The GPU ran at 100% in some scenarios, and the CPU frequently hit 80-100% usage, particularly during the shader compiling phase or cutscenes.
Troubleshooting and Testing
Stress Testing:

You ran Prime95 to test CPU stability. Initial results showed spikes up to 95°C, but after cleaning and reseating the cooler, temperatures stabilized under 80°C.
This indicated potential past cooling issues, but the CPU remained questionable under load.
Power Supply Concerns:

You tested the system plugged directly into the wall (removing the extension lead), which helped reduce crashes temporarily.
The Corsair TX750M was identified as sufficient on paper, but power issues could still exist due to age or fault.
System Monitoring:

You set up MSI Afterburner to monitor CPU and GPU temps, usage, and clock speeds during gameplay. This confirmed high GPU and CPU usage during demanding moments.
BIOS and Drivers:

You updated your BIOS and GPU drivers to eliminate potential software conflicts, which helped stabilize the system somewhat but didn’t fully resolve the issues.
Shopping and CPU Considerations
Upgrades Debated:

You considered upgrading your CPU to either the Ryzen 7 5700X or 5800X3D.
The 5700X offered excellent value for £170, while the 5800X3D provided better gaming performance for £280 but was more expensive.
Ryzen 7 5700X3D Confusion:

A suspicious listing for a "5700X3D" caused confusion as this product wasn’t initially recognized as legitimate. Later research confirmed the 5700X3D is real, though the specific eBay listing needed careful vetting.
Outstanding Issues
Inconsistent Restarts:

Despite troubleshooting, the system still restarted during gameplay or while paused, with occasional Kernel Power 41 errors logged in Event Viewer. These could indicate:
Power delivery problems (PSU or motherboard-related).
Software/driver conflicts.
CPU instability under load.
Blue Screens:

A KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR occurred, pointing toward potential issues with:
Disk I/O (storage problems, corrupted files).
Memory issues (RAM instability).
Performance Frustrations:

You were disappointed at having to lower settings to medium/1440p on a high-end RTX 3080 Ti and 4K monitor. This indicated your CPU might be bottlenecking performance in some cases.
Current State
Progress:

System stability improved somewhat after BIOS updates, driver updates, and cooler reseating.
Final Fantasy XVI worked intermittently but still caused restarts at higher settings.
Next Steps:

Decide on a CPU upgrade (5700X or 5800X3D) based on budget and performance needs.
Potentially replace the PSU if restarts persist.
Consider running CHKDSK to address potential disk errors.
Open Questions:

Will the current setup perform stably after these fixes?
Is the PSU the underlying issue causing crashes, or is the CPU/motherboard to blame?
Summary and Recommendations
Short-Term:

Continue monitoring your system during gaming to identify remaining weak points.
Test another power supply (if available) to rule out PSU faults.
Stick to medium/high settings at 1440p until stability improves.
Long-Term:

Upgrade to a Ryzen 7 5700X or 5800X3D for better gaming performance and future-proofing.
Consider a 4K monitor with a higher refresh rate if smoother gaming is a priority.
If issues persist, evaluate replacing the PSU or RAM to ensure system reliability.
